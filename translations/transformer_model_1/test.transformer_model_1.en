<unk> years ago, here at TED, <unk> <unk> <unk> a challenge of <unk>  <unk> called the <unk> <unk>
And the idea is very simple.
<unk> of four people have to build the <unk> <unk> possible that you can <unk> out of <unk> <unk>  <unk> 20 <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> a <unk> of <unk>  and a <unk>
The <unk> has to be <unk> on the top of the <unk>
And even if it looks very <unk> <unk> of it is pretty <unk>  because it <unk> people get very <unk>
So I thought it was an interesting idea, and I did it in a lab on the <unk>
And it was a huge <unk>
And since then, I have <unk>  about <unk> <unk> of this guy around the world with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
There is something in this <unk>  which is important to the nature of <unk>  and I'd like to share some of these <unk> with you.
<unk> most people are <unk> with <unk> to the <unk> <unk>
You know, you <unk> what <unk> might <unk>  <unk> for <unk> <unk> and then <unk> the time <unk>
<unk> of <unk> and <unk> the <unk>
<unk> most of the time <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> when the time is to <unk> somebody <unk> out the <unk>  and they <unk> it into <unk> <unk>  they do a step <unk> and <unk> it.
<unk> the work.
But what happens most of the time, the <unk> --  is that the <unk> <unk> in a <unk>  because the <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> and <unk> the whole <unk>
There is a number of people --  -- many more <unk> <unk> <unk> --  and between the <unk> are <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
And there are <unk>  that have a lot more <unk> <unk> <unk> and among <unk> there are <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that's <unk>
As he says, <unk>  not just create <unk> <unk>  but it's also <unk> <unk> <unk>
And your question is <unk>  How is that? How is that? What <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I said, <unk>  <unk> of the <unk> <unk> time --  I try to become the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't spend time for <unk>
But there is also <unk> <unk>
And the reason is that the <unk> students are <unk>  to find the best <unk>
And then <unk>
And later, what happens is that when they put the <unk> in <unk>  don't have more time, and what it <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
What children do <unk> is that they start by the <unk>  and they <unk> <unk> one after the <unk>  They always <unk> on the top of the <unk>  they have a whole chance of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> that this kind of <unk>  is the <unk> of the <unk> process.
And with every <unk> the children have a <unk> <unk> on what it works and what it works.
So the ability to work on <unk> is <unk>  but we see how different work <unk>
The media for most people is about 50 <unk>  per <unk> for the students of <unk> about <unk>  <unk> a little <unk> but not very, very much of <unk>
Who does better than <unk>
<unk> and <unk> because of the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> is the <unk> which I ever <unk>
And <unk> Why do you believe that <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  are the key to build <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then we have a little bit better than the <unk>
But this is where it gets interesting.
If you have a <unk> <unk>  the group can do much better.
It's <unk> You get a little bit in the <unk> <unk> that that <unk> <unk> <unk>  You can see it in <unk> And <unk>
Because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk>
And all the groups that <unk> and <unk> attention to work --  <unk> <unk> <unk> the result of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk>  and their <unk> bring them to a safe <unk>
If you have 10 groups that usually work well, you will have six <unk> <unk> that are in <unk>
And I <unk> an interesting <unk>
I <unk> <unk> for a time.
I put on <unk> <unk> dollars a <unk> in software at the <unk>
What do you think happened to the students of <unk>
<unk> was the <unk>
That's what happened.
<unk> of the team created a <unk> <unk>
If one of them had built a <unk> <unk> <unk>  would bring to your home <unk>
It's not interesting that a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have <unk> new <unk> with the same <unk>
What do you think that's <unk>
Now they had the value of a <unk>
The same <unk> from <unk>  has become better <unk>
They created the <unk> <unk> over time.
So, I'm <unk> important to the nature of the <unk> and <unk>  <unk> then <unk> because someone should go through the time to write a challenge <unk>
The reason is <unk> help create <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>  to help groups to build <unk> <unk>  and <unk> <unk>
And what a <unk> challenge is to help <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  every project is not <unk>
The <unk> <unk> an <unk> experience -- a common language --  a common position to build a <unk>
And so, this is the <unk> value of this simple <unk>
And those of you were <unk>  can go to <unk>
It's a <unk> that you can have a look at how to build <unk>
There are <unk> step for <unk>
There are <unk> <unk> from all over the world -- on how people <unk> and <unk> the <unk>
There is also the <unk> of the world.
And the most important <unk> I think, is that design is really a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> of all the <unk>  and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>  the <unk> and the <unk>  to <unk> the challenge that you <unk> in your hand.
And again, a little <unk> of <unk>  is all that you need to <unk> a <unk> moment in a moment.
And that can really do the <unk>
Thank you very much.
<unk> <unk> that you have a big <unk>  <unk> in <unk> TED TED TED --  is a machine of time.
Everybody in this room has to <unk>
You can go <unk> you can go to the <unk>  You can't <unk> where you <unk>
And I would ask you to know what I <unk> because I asked my friends --  in the last <unk> and everybody wants to come back to the <unk>
We don't want to get back to before we think about cars or <unk> or <unk> <unk>
I don't know.
I'm <unk> that there is a kind of <unk>  at the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk>
But I don't do part of that <unk> I have to <unk>
I don't want to go back to the <unk> and not because I'm <unk>  is because the possibility on this planet  don't <unk> go <unk>
So I want to go into the machine.
This is the best time that there has been been on this planet -- in every field that we can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
There's never been a time like this.
My <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
My <unk> <unk> that number to <unk>
My parents are <unk> <unk>
So it's better that there's a <unk> at the beginning of the number of my <unk>
But it's not just about people like us,  is a much bigger than this.
A child born in New <unk> today --  can try to live as far as the most <unk> <unk> in the world of 100 years ago.
<unk> It's a <unk>
How does it <unk>
<unk> <unk> has <unk> billion people on this planet.
It has changed the <unk> of the <unk>  as no war has ever done.
If you <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> world -- <unk> <unk> <unk> million people just a generation ago  don't have <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
somebody knows what it <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- our ability to <unk> billion people,  these are <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
And to me, the <unk> <unk> <unk>  to try things things --  to try to see if you <unk> <unk>  is one of the great <unk> <unk>
These were the good <unk>
The good news were the good news --  because there are other <unk> and have been <unk> a lot of times, one of them is --  -- all we have <unk> a billion people go to bed <unk>  on this planet, every day.
This number is <unk> with incredible <unk> and it's <unk>
And we don't have used our <unk> <unk> to <unk> the planet.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  are <unk> and they're <unk> in <unk>  And if we don't <unk> our <unk> to <unk> out of this <unk>  <unk>
So the question is, we can <unk> I think <unk>
I think it's clear that you can produce food  to <unk> billion people without <unk> the land that we <unk>
I think it's possible to <unk> this world of energy -- without that this <unk>
I think really <unk> and no, it's not a <unk> <unk>
But here is the thing that <unk> me the night --  -- one of the things that <unk> me <unk>
We never had so <unk> to <unk> <unk> as we need now, <unk>  and we're not going to be in the position of <unk>  <unk> to the best of how we might have today.
We're at a step from <unk> really, really, in many <unk>
But even though I think we should go back  <unk> 300 years before the <unk>  to find a time time when we <unk> the <unk> -- a period that we've <unk> them <unk> and more <unk> than we do.
People <unk> in what you do, and people do with a lot of force that we can't <unk>
<unk> the truth can <unk>
<unk> everybody to your own <unk>  They also have the right to their <unk> on the <unk>  but you know what you have no <unk>
You don't have the right to your <unk> I don't <unk>
I put a little <unk>
A <unk> of years ago I wrote a story about <unk>  to <unk> New <unk> a short <unk>
And I was <unk> that somebody <unk> -- that it was <unk> to what it is, after all,  The measure of health health <unk> more <unk> than all the human history.
I didn't know what to do,  so I did the <unk> I wrote the story and I was <unk>
Not much more <unk>  I wrote a story about <unk> food.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
People were <unk>
So I wrote a story about <unk>  and I couldn't figure out why   <unk> people like <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk>  because <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- because we <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the work of nature.
But how do I do my job. I wrote the story and I <unk>
I mean, I'm a <unk>  <unk> go to <unk> <unk> there.
But these stories <unk> me -- and I couldn't understand why but I did did it <unk>
The problem was that those <unk> who were making me <unk>  They were not <unk> <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> people for well.
They were exactly like people in this <unk>
And the thing <unk> me <unk>
But then I said, <unk> we have to be <unk>  we're at a point, on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship with the <unk> which was a time.
We talk about it.
We talk about it in terms of <unk> using <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>  All right, and I think we know what we <unk>
We lost <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk>  and sometimes sometimes in science --  and it's <unk> that is <unk>
Let me just do some <unk>  and people <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I mean, everybody has his <unk>
We have questions and problems and problems with the people who had always <unk>
So <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't know anything about <unk>
But here is the <unk> when the evidence comes <unk>  <unk> <unk> and we're not very <unk> in this.
And I think that the reason that we have in the <unk> of fear  that I have never seen and I hope I've never seen and I hope I've never seen it.
<unk> 12 years ago I was <unk> a story,  that <unk> <unk> there was a <unk> between <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> against <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Very good.
<unk> studies were made to see if it was true.
And it turns out to be hundreds of <unk> is a important.
<unk> the data.
<unk> from the United States, to the <unk> from the <unk>  and everybody was <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
He didn't <unk> He did it because we don't think about the <unk>  to what we think about to see what we think we think about what it makes us feel <unk>
We don't think about a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>  from the government show us <unk>  and I think it <unk>
But you know what?
<unk> have been <unk>
<unk> because this is a <unk>  The United States is one of the few countries in the world -- where the number of <unk> against the <unk> is <unk>
It's <unk> and we need to <unk>
It's <unk>
What happened to us to do something about it.
Now, I do that?
<unk> somebody here has the <unk>
Some of the audience has ever seen a <unk> person <unk>
<unk>
In this country not <unk> <unk> but it happened <unk> times in the world <unk>
I've been a little bit of <unk> for <unk>  20 <unk>
But since it's not happened here, we can <unk> from the head --  -- and people like <unk> <unk>  can go around <unk> <unk> <unk>  -- <unk> of fear and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And they can do it because  don't <unk> the difference between <unk> and <unk>
I don't know that these two things seem to <unk>  but they're not the <unk>
But it's something that we have to <unk> and we have to <unk>
<unk> was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He's got <unk> by one of his <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> no <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> not <unk>
Paul <unk> <unk>
It just made a <unk> against <unk> with other people.
It <unk> the life of <unk> 500 <unk> children -- every year in the developing world.
<unk> <unk> isn't it?
It's <unk> if it's not that Paul goes around the <unk> to talk about the <unk>  says how <unk> and people should just <unk>
And he says in these <unk>
So Paul is <unk> a <unk>
When Paul in <unk> <unk>  can't <unk> without a <unk> <unk>
They call it home -- because they like a <unk> <unk> who know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul has created a <unk>
I wouldn't have to <unk> but the <unk> are <unk>
If you try to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We have a new <unk> in this country.
And it's going to be <unk> and among not very <unk> the kids -- <unk> <unk> again, because it's just a question of <unk>
and not only <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> even <unk> Why <unk>
One of my <unk> <unk> wrote a couple of weeks ago and said,  that <unk> me a little <unk>
<unk> told me before.
She wouldn't have to <unk> her <unk>
<unk> <unk>
OK.
Why? Because there is no <unk>
We didn't have <unk> in the United States.
<unk> you don't know, maybe a guy is <unk> on a <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk>  and it's going to <unk> <unk> right now it's over the <unk>
<unk> <unk> in a couple of <unk> <unk> a <unk>  <unk> <unk> here to <unk> <unk>  and <unk> <unk> to one of these <unk> <unk> <unk>
He doesn't know to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk>  and we don't know it because it's so that it works the world.
This is the planet that we <unk> We don't <unk> that it's <unk>
We <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> a little bit of <unk>  to start the <unk>
I know that you did because half of the Americans do it every day.
<unk> that <unk> as it <unk> to <unk> <unk> and it doesn't matter how often  <unk> that are <unk>
<unk> data <unk>
<unk> <unk> more <unk> than it never <unk>
But <unk> you want to <unk> <unk> billion dollars per <unk> <unk>  I am with <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Why do that? Why?
I think I <unk> <unk> the big <unk>
<unk> the big <unk> <unk> We don't <unk>
And we do good. Our <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's <unk> million people.
It's an incredibly <unk> <unk> and <unk> even for those of us who can <unk> it.
So <unk> <unk> and the people who <unk> us.
<unk> between the great <unk>
It's <unk> We <unk> the great <unk>
You know, it's a <unk> problem, because this stuff is a <unk>  and it took billions of dollars.
I have a whole series of examples here.
<unk> of <unk> <unk> -- a <unk>  <unk> -- I don't know what a <unk> <unk> -- I don't even know what --  -- I don't know what --  -- I don't even know what --   -- I don't know what it is,
You know a <unk> When I say these things, people ask me, <unk>  and they say, "What do you <unk> that people do what they <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> a <unk> You <unk>
Because I'm not interested in if it's the <unk> of <unk> for <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>  to say <unk> I don't have <unk> to listen to the <unk>  of the <unk> on the <unk> or if he says a few <unk> cancer that wants to <unk> the <unk>
When you get the way to <unk>  to <unk> science and evidence with <unk> and evidence and <unk>  <unk> in a place where you don't <unk> <unk>
<unk> like <unk> <unk> in South <unk>
It's got 400 <unk> of his <unk>  <unk> to say that <unk>  <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk>  <unk> better than the <unk> that we know  can <unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk> of thousands of <unk> <unk> in a country that has been <unk>  more than any <unk> from this <unk>
To <unk> we don't get to <unk>  that there are no <unk> for these <unk>
There are <unk>
Now, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> on the <unk>
It's <unk> it's not <unk>
Every single thing that <unk> every <unk> of <unk> <unk> every <unk> of <unk>  every <unk> of <unk> <unk> has been <unk> <unk>
You see, there were no <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
There were no <unk>
There were no longer <unk> <unk> we <unk>
We did this over the last <unk> years.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> no.
And we have <unk> what we don't know.
Now we can do it <unk> more <unk>
And there are <unk> certain that we <unk>
But we can <unk> things like <unk> At in the <unk>  and this <unk> million people will <unk> their life.
And we don't want to <unk>
I've got to say, <unk> I don't know.
We're <unk> to <unk>
Why?
The things I always hear about <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> We don't want to be <unk>  <unk> with the same thing, it's <unk>
We don't want the companies to <unk> on life.
We don't want the companies are <unk> <unk> <unk>
You know what the answer to this?
It's <unk> You <unk>
It's <unk> we have a huge <unk> problem -- but it's not <unk>
It has nothing to do with <unk>
It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>
You know science is not a <unk>
It's not a <unk>
It's not even <unk> it's a <unk>
It's a <unk> sometimes gives <unk> <unk>  but sometimes the idea that we should not <unk>  to the science of doing its work --  -- because we are fear -- it's really <unk> -- and it's <unk> to millions of people --  of <unk>
You know, in the next 50 years, we'll be <unk> to produce the <unk> of food in more than what we <unk> now,  <unk> for <unk>
These are the <unk> in the last 30 years.
<unk> <unk>
They need them.
Why? <unk> <unk> <unk>
We don't want to <unk> people to eat <unk> like <unk> <unk>
<unk> billion people <unk>
<unk> a little bit of a <unk>
But <unk> just <unk> <unk> <unk>
It has no <unk> <unk> has no <unk>  but the scientists are <unk> the way to <unk> right now.
So a lot of people could eat less the risk of getting <unk>
You don't know about <unk> and you know a <unk>
It would be very <unk> It wouldn't be a <unk> of <unk>  but it would be very <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  because we are <unk>
I mean, <unk> why are we <unk> this <unk>
Just because we don't want to <unk> the genes and <unk>
It's about <unk> <unk> It's not about <unk> <unk>
It's not about our <unk> <unk> for <unk> or <unk> or our <unk> to get more food <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
Don't <unk> the <unk>
It's about <unk> the life of people,  and it would be <unk> to understand what it is.
Because -- you want to <unk> --  -- if we don't understand it, and we <unk> it right now,  -- we're going to do something that I don't think <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
There is no way to <unk> what's going on.
It's <unk> it's <unk> it's <unk>  and we've got to <unk>
So, after this <unk> <unk>  you might have <unk> <unk> you still get into this  <unk> machine of time and go into the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
It's <unk> on the present now,  but we have an incredible <unk>
We can <unk> the machine as we <unk>
We have a chance to go where to <unk>  and we're going to really go where we <unk>
We need to do these <unk> and we have to <unk>  but when we go into the <unk> of the time and we have to be happy to do it.
And I know -- I know --  I think the world needs of them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> was <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk>  when you <unk> a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> by a <unk>  a <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> without <unk> <unk> that only had two <unk>
I'm going to tell a story that many of you know --  because the <unk> of <unk> <unk>  for <unk> <unk> <unk>  with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the great <unk>  with <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> part of <unk> <unk> <unk>  and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> part of <unk> <unk>  and the <unk> <unk> --  -- the <unk> which was <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and 30 years later, <unk> <unk> like a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the center of <unk> <unk>
<unk> all of you to read the <unk> book <unk> or looking at the <unk> <unk>  to understand not just the <unk> <unk>  that <unk> between these two <unk>
My name is <unk> <unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> by 10 years --  and my <unk> for the next 10 years -- is to try to save the world in real life -- as it is in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
To do that I have a <unk>  and <unk> in the <unk> more people,  <unk> all of you to spend more <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> moment three billion hours a week at <unk> <unk>
Some of you may have <unk>  <unk> a lot of time <unk>
maybe too time, <unk>  How many problems <unk> we have to solve in the real world.
In fact, in my <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk>  actually is the <unk>
<unk> billion hours a week is not <unk>  <unk> to solve the <unk> problems in the world.
<unk> I think if we want to <unk>  the next century on this planet -- we have to <unk> that <unk>
I have <unk> that total <unk> that we need --  is <unk> billion hours of <unk> every <unk>
It's probably a <unk> idea, so the <unk> to <unk> the <unk>
If we want to solve problems which <unk> <unk>  I think we want to have <unk> to play <unk> <unk>  I think we have to have <unk> to play <unk>  for at least <unk> billion hours to the <unk>  No, it's <unk>
Here is the <unk> This is a <unk> <unk> because I think to play is so important for the <unk> of human species.
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> he wanted to play <unk>
So he <unk> some <unk> while he <unk>
And this is a <unk> game.
If you're not <unk> <unk>  You can see some of the <unk> of this <unk>
You probably see that a sense of <unk>  a little bit of <unk> but also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a very <unk> problem.
If you're <unk> <unk> <unk>  some <unk> the <unk> around the <unk> and around the <unk>  I'm a <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> show <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> a step from something called a <unk> <unk>
<unk> is a <unk> you already <unk> OK.
So we have <unk> <unk> between us.
A <unk> <unk> is a result of so <unk> <unk> <unk> that doesn't seem to you to when you don't know.
It's almost beyond the <unk> <unk> and when you get a <unk>  to find out what you're really <unk> This is a <unk> <unk>
This <unk> a step from a <unk> <unk>
And this is the <unk> that we need to see  on the <unk> of millions of <unk> of problems in the world -- as we <unk> the <unk> of somebody <unk> --  -- is at a step from a <unk> <unk>
<unk> this is the <unk> that we see  in the life of all the days as we <unk> to deal with <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> which I call <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> in my old <unk> --  of <unk> in <unk> where I did the <unk>  on because we more <unk> in the <unk> of the real life.
And this is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> that we are not <unk> as far as the <unk>
And I don't mean by just as <unk> <unk> even though the success is <unk>  <unk> more <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
But I mean <unk> in the sense of <unk> to do something <unk>  <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And when we are in a <unk> world -- I think a lot of us become  the best <unk> of <unk> if we <unk> the most of us are able to <unk> on a problem --  for all the time <unk> <unk> after a <unk> and try <unk>
And in the <unk> life when you get a <unk>  when you get a <unk> often you <unk> --  -- we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>
We never <unk> these <unk> as we <unk>  simply don't have in a game.
So that's what I wanted to study <unk>
<unk> that in a game we <unk>  to feel that we can't get any <unk>
How can we <unk> those <unk> from <unk>  and <unk> the <unk> world.
So I studied so <unk> <unk> of <unk>  which is really <unk> <unk> to solve problems in a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I started to look at some things --  that make <unk> <unk> so possible in the <unk> <unk>
The first is that, when you go into one of these games games --  -- especially in <unk> of <unk>  There are different <unk> different <unk> -- which <unk> to the point from a <unk> <unk> to save the world.
But not a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to your <unk> in play.
So you can <unk> it.
Don't give you a <unk> <unk>
But it's on your <unk> So you've got to <unk> <unk>
But there is no <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>  you don't get time to <unk> the <unk>  There is always something <unk> and important to do.
And there are also <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> hundreds of thousands of people,  <unk> to you for <unk> your <unk> <unk>
It's not something so common in the <unk> life -- this feeling that we have <unk> <unk> <unk>
And there is also this <unk> <unk> this <unk> that <unk>  on because we are what we're doing.
And then we <unk> this <unk> <unk>
you've heard about <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
Don't <unk> that kind of <unk> <unk> in real life.
When you look at this <unk> I don't <unk>  <unk> in front of a <unk> and <unk> in <unk> ideas --
Don't <unk> that kind of <unk> in real life.
Now, the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk> of <unk>  is that <unk> so much <unk> to be at a <unk> <unk> all the <unk>  that <unk> to go through our time in these <unk>
<unk> is better than <unk>
It's for that, <unk> <unk> all the <unk> of <unk>  have spent <unk> million years in the <unk>  to solve the <unk> problems of <unk>
This is not necessarily <unk>
But <unk> in <unk>  <unk> million years ago --  was the time when one of our <unk> <unk> in <unk>
That was the first <unk> to walk <unk>
OK, so when we talk about how long we are <unk>  in <unk> the only <unk> <unk> is to talk about times --  -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  -- that <unk> is a <unk> thing --  -- but also <unk> because we have discovered  that all of time <unk> -- we're able to <unk> what we are <unk> as human <unk> and we are to have more <unk>
This is <unk> I <unk>
So let's look at this interesting <unk>
It was <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> young <unk> today in a country with a strong <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> hours is an interesting <unk> for two <unk>
First of all, for the children in the United States  <unk> hours is <unk> number of hours that <unk> at school from the <unk> <unk> to the <unk>  if you're in your <unk> every day.
So we <unk> <unk>  <unk> of <unk> <unk> in which <unk> young people like being <unk> <unk> --  <unk> at the time at school in which it all <unk>
And some of you will probably read the new book of <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you have seen it in his theory of <unk> <unk>  the theory of <unk> hours for <unk>
It's <unk> on <unk> research in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that if you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- the <unk> <unk> of <unk> to any thing --  -- the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> in that something -- as the best people in the world.
So, what we have now for <unk>  is <unk> generation of young people who are <unk> of the play.
So, the question is,  <unk> in what become <unk> these <unk>
because if you could figure out what it is -- we would have a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is the number of people in the world -- <unk> at least a day to play <unk>
These are our genes of play.
500 million people who are <unk> <unk> in something.
And in the next <unk> -- we will have another billion <unk> <unk> <unk> in that something.
If we already <unk> this is what it <unk> to us --  -- the <unk> of <unk> is <unk> <unk> that <unk> energy and energy and <unk> with the <unk> <unk>  instead of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is a billion <unk> in the next <unk>
This is <unk> us to <unk> billion <unk>
So I started thinking about what <unk>  these games are <unk> us in <unk>
These are four <unk> that I <unk> The first is a <unk> <unk>
OK. <unk> like a <unk> form of <unk>
A <unk> <unk> is the <unk> to <unk> <unk>  to deal with a <unk> with the <unk> of having a <unk> hope of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> always <unk> that a <unk> <unk> is possible -- and it's possible for <unk> and <unk> right now.
The <unk> <unk> are not with your hands
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> in <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
There are a lot of interesting research that show  How are we better with other people after having <unk> with them, even though they have <unk> <unk>
And the reason is that it takes a lot of <unk> to play with <unk>  We have <unk> that <unk> their time with us,  that <unk> with the same rules and the same <unk> and the same <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of the game.
So, playing together with <unk>  the <unk> of <unk> and <unk>
And it turns out that we really <unk> more <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You know, there's a reason why the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> of <unk>  <unk> hours to the <unk> almost as a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's because <unk> as we are <unk> <unk> that we actually are more happy -- --  -- rather than <unk> <unk> or time.
We know that we are <unk> as <unk>  to work <unk> to work with something which has <unk>
And the <unk> <unk> are <unk> to work in <unk>  <unk> if it's <unk> a <unk> <unk>
To <unk> a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> to <unk> <unk>  to stories on a <unk> <unk>
For example, a little <unk> information to help create a <unk>
They all <unk> the largest <unk> in the world.
The second largest <unk> in the world, with almost <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> of <unk>  <unk> million people use it every <unk>
They have <unk> more information about <unk> of <unk>  in <unk> than any other <unk> in the world.
They are <unk> <unk> <unk>
They are <unk> a <unk> source of information  <unk> <unk> of <unk>
OK, these are the four <unk> that <unk> a <unk> thing.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> of <unk>
These are people <unk> to be <unk>  <unk> to change the world.
The other problem is that <unk> <unk> to be able to change <unk> <unk> <unk>  but not the real <unk>
This is the problem I'm trying to <unk>
There's a <unk> called <unk> <unk>
His studies are <unk> He's <unk> the reason why  -- people <unk> so much energy and <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
He said, <unk> <unk> what <unk> <unk>  less than a mass of mass to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And it's a <unk> so it's <unk> and <unk>   <unk> like me, I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But he <unk> he <unk> that this is a <unk> thing, <unk>  because the <unk> <unk> can get more in <unk> <unk> than in the real life.
You have to have a more <unk> <unk> <unk> in a game that not in real life.
<unk> a better <unk> and <unk> more <unk> in a game that not in real life.
So, <unk> for now, it's <unk> <unk>  for the <unk> <unk> we have more time in the <unk> <unk> which in the real world -- and I'm not <unk> that this is now <unk> but it is not in any case, a <unk> situation -- we have to start <unk> to make the most similar to play.
This is <unk> by something that <unk>  <unk> years ago.
These are <unk> <unk> made of <unk> <unk>  <unk> we had <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> we had <unk> <unk> of <unk>  And these <unk> the first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> maybe you know this story.
It's the story of the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> that the <unk> in <unk> <unk>  were <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>  during a period of <unk>
<unk> that the <unk> was so <unk> that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to do something <unk>
People <unk> the population was in <unk>  it was a <unk> situation had to have a <unk> <unk>
So, in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> for all the <unk>
One day, everyone would have <unk>
The next day, everybody would have <unk>
And it turns out that <unk> in <unk> games --  -- from the time that to play is so <unk>  and <unk> us in a state of <unk> <unk>  that <unk> the fact of not <unk>
And so one day you <unk>  and one day.
And on the second <unk>  <unk> so 18 years, <unk> to the <unk>  <unk> one day and <unk> that <unk>
I think that's exactly the way we use <unk> <unk> on the day.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> from everything that doesn't work --  in our environment in our <unk> environment from everything we don't know about life in <unk>  and <unk> what we need from the <unk>
But we don't necessarily have to <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> after 18 years, the <unk> <unk> didn't <unk> <unk>  So the <unk> <unk> that would have <unk> <unk> to <unk>
<unk> the entire <unk> to <unk>  <unk> a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk>  and <unk> <unk> to a new land where we <unk>  <unk> behind the right number of people to <unk> with the <unk> resources --  with the hope of getting their <unk> from some other <unk> where they could <unk>
That's a little <unk> right?
<unk> <unk> studies have <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that the <unk> that they would have <unk> <unk> <unk> the same DNA <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> scientists have <unk> that the <unk> story from <unk> is a <unk> story.
And <unk> they found an <unk> of a global global <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So this amazing story could be <unk>  could actually have <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk>  They could have <unk> their <unk> <unk> in the <unk> for 18 years -- to then be so <unk>  and know how good <unk> in the game --  -- to the point that the entire <unk>
OK, we can do it <unk>
<unk> in <unk> of <unk> by the <unk>
It was the first <unk> game in real time --  of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> This 16 years ago.
They were <unk> for 18 years, and we have <unk> <unk> for 16 years.
I mean, we're <unk> for the <unk> <unk>
They <unk> half of the population on a new world.
This is where the idea of <unk> billion hours of play <unk>
<unk> the half of us <unk>  to spend <unk> on the day in <unk> <unk>  until we <unk> the problems of the real world.
<unk> what you're going to <unk> "How do we solve the problems of the real world  in a <unk> Well, this is what I <unk> my work during the <unk> years,  <unk> <unk> for the <unk>
In our <unk> <unk> we have this <unk>  that <unk> our idea of how we should <unk> with the future.
We don't want to <unk> the future.
What we want to do is <unk> the future.
You can imagine the best results in the best -- and then we want to give the opportunity to <unk> to <unk> <unk>
You can imagine <unk> <unk>  to give people the tools to <unk>
I'm going to show you three games that I did  And that are a <unk> to give people the tools to create <unk> <unk> in their future.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
We did this game in <unk>
It's a <unk> game in which you <unk> to <unk> to a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is not <unk>  but we have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to believe that <unk> and to live the real life -- as if you try to <unk> So when you go into the <unk>  -- <unk> <unk> -- and <unk> give you the news that <unk> <unk>  and <unk> give you a news in time <unk>  <unk> -- things that are not <unk> on the <unk>
<unk> on the <unk>  if there are <unk> if you have <unk> <unk>  and you have to think about how you <unk> your life -- if this is <unk> <unk> you to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We <unk> this game with <unk> <unk> in <unk> and we <unk> them from then for the three years <unk>  And what I can tell you is that it's a <unk> experience.
<unk> wants to change the way that they live  because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good <unk> to do it.
But if you <unk> them in a <unk> <unk>  and they said, "You don't have <unk>
This is a <unk> story that you can <unk>
You can see yourself as a <unk>
Most of our <unk> then <unk> <unk> which has learned in play.
So, for the <unk> game <unk> to save the world,  we decided to <unk> more <unk> <unk>
We have a game called <unk> <unk> for the <unk>  and the <unk> <unk> a <unk> has <unk> <unk> that <unk> only <unk> years on this planet.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We asked people to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> team -- there's a <unk> team -- there's <unk> <unk> the <unk> -- and they all have something to do to save the world,  But in our <unk> instead of <unk>   -- but in our <unk> <unk> instead of <unk>  -- all of the <unk> <unk> <unk>  -- the future of the <unk>  -- the future of <unk> and <unk> the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future <unk> future <unk> future -- the future --  --  -- the future --
<unk> people <unk> for eight <unk>  They have <unk> 500 incredibly <unk> that you can find if you go <unk> and <unk> on Google <unk>
To <unk> the last <unk>  <unk> the <unk> three <unk> This is a game <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> with <unk> <unk> to Africa for <unk>  -- we're starting to learn the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
There is a story in <unk> <unk> <unk> of level -- thank you very much.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  to share this game with <unk> <unk>  <unk> in the world, in <unk> areas in the world, in <unk> areas in <unk> <unk>  to start thinking about the world.
It's now <unk>
I want to give you a question.
What do you think you <unk>
We have all these <unk> <unk> -- we have these <unk> which are <unk> <unk> of what we might <unk>  but none of these <unk> has still <unk> the real world.
Well, I hope that <unk> <unk> with me that the <unk> <unk> are a human <unk>  that we can use to make <unk> in the <unk> world -- which is a powerful <unk> for the <unk>  that we have these <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> the ability to <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> and <unk> of meaning <unk>
I really hope that we can <unk> <unk>  to play for <unk> on this planet for another century,  and my hope is that I <unk> to <unk> on this planet for another century, and <unk> as a <unk>
When we go back to the next <unk> of two things are <unk> --  that we can make any future we can <unk> <unk> and that we can play any <unk> <unk>
So, I give you the <unk> that <unk> the world.
Thank you.
For some time I got interested in <unk>  can be a <unk> thing --  -- that a <unk> if you <unk> <unk>  less than it from my point of view --  -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  -- <unk> <unk> <unk>  -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  -- <unk> because of <unk>  <unk> thought about <unk>  <unk> because it thinks they just <unk>
which what's the <unk> is supposed to a <unk> or something <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> for example,  if you have a <unk> <unk> in the body -- called <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> it becomes -- something true for the <unk> if you <unk>
To <unk>  I want to show you a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a <unk> which is in all the books for children from the <unk>
I learned it from only <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> it for you and then I'll show you.
And so I'm going to tell you why I have it.
That's what you do.
The <unk> that you can <unk> my <unk> which you can <unk>
<unk> just my <unk> in my <unk>
<unk> on the <unk>
to be sure that no <unk> or <unk> from my <unk>
I'm going to <unk> my <unk>
The way you see that ever <unk>  -- something could be <unk> <unk> here -- nothing is <unk> on my <unk>
And that is <unk> <unk>
<unk> to <unk> my <unk> and if all went <unk>  my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In fact, it's so <unk> to his place -- I can <unk>  and the <unk> don't <unk>
<unk> on or down from my <unk>
<unk> <unk> You can <unk> anything <unk>
<unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> often <unk>
that are <unk> to the <unk> because you can learn --  -- this <unk> even though <unk> is very simple.
Many of you in this room you have this <unk>
That's what happens  <unk> the <unk> in my hand.
<unk> <unk> <unk> my <unk>
to <unk> that nothing <unk> or <unk> from my <unk>  this is a <unk>
The reason I'm looking at <unk>  is because that's the <unk> <unk>
The moment that my hand is <unk>   This <unk> here, my <unk> here is <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> from <unk> into a position --  that <unk> out so --
There is somebody who didn't have <unk> here.
It's like that, <unk> <unk>
And when I <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We can talk about why it is <unk>  because we don't know that there are only three <unk> <unk> --  -- because the <unk> and the way it <unk> <unk> <unk> two, two, two, three, <unk> <unk>
But that's not the <unk> Right? And when I <unk> my <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not through the <unk> <unk> but through <unk> <unk>  <unk> my <unk> here.
And when I look at my <unk> same thing,  <unk> when I <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> your hand. <unk> comes away.
It's a <unk> that you can do with your friends and <unk> Thank you.
Now, <unk>  What does this with <unk> <unk>
I read a <unk> a year ago  that <unk> me the <unk>
I'm not a <unk> or a <unk> for which --  has been a <unk> thing.
It turns out that if you <unk>  a <unk> in the form of a <unk> <unk> <unk> has a <unk> <unk>
But if you look at the shape and you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the form of a more <unk> --  -- and the blue <unk> is <unk> <unk>
Even though none of the two  has no <unk> -- they're <unk> <unk>
But a <unk> <unk> is not <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
<unk>  He really <unk> me <unk>
But <unk> is not here that <unk>
<unk> <unk> are more <unk> than any <unk>
A <unk> <unk> which is <unk> by a <unk> and <unk> <unk>  is better than a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> has a <unk>
One <unk> two times a day --  is not as <unk> as three <unk> --  Now I don't remember the <unk> <unk>
But the <unk>
What these <unk> have a <unk>
And the shape has a <unk>
And if you want the <unk> <unk> you have to use a <unk>
Right? A <unk> with something --  a couple of <unk> of something <unk>
I <unk> it in a <unk>
This is an <unk> image in their <unk>  much more <unk> than the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
It's <unk> this <unk> I'm going to show you    Another time when we have <unk>
The point is -- the <unk> <unk> is not <unk> as much as the <unk> that blue is not as <unk> as a <unk>
And no one of them has a <unk> <unk>
It's just your believe that makes them <unk>  in your <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I wanted to see if I could take this idea  and I was going to a <unk> <unk>
And something that is a <unk> <unk> <unk> and make it <unk>
And we know from that <unk>  -- when you want to use <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> Very <unk>
You know that a <unk>
This is my <unk> This is not  <unk> <unk> of <unk>
This is my <unk> This is not a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to <unk> my <unk>  and <unk> this <unk> to the <unk> part of the <unk>
If you <unk> <unk> --  if you <unk> <unk> I did it for some friends --  in the <unk> <unk> the other <unk> and for some of some of them not <unk>  and a woman is almost <unk>
So if you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that doesn't <unk> for the next few <unk>  In fact, I'll do the first part of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> you can look <unk>
This is what <unk> right here,  <unk> of my <unk> on the <unk> part of my <unk> <unk> a little <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk> you.
And now a little bit through my <unk>  and outside the other way.
Now, we're in the same position that we were  with the <unk> of <unk>
More or <unk>  But you can't <unk> my <unk> now, right?
So I'm going to <unk> That's two  <unk> <unk> five <unk> <unk>
I know what people think about when it <unk>
<unk> <unk> it's not going to be so <unk> <unk> <unk> just to <unk> some <unk>
So, let me give you a <unk>
How do you <unk> <unk>
I know    <unk> out there behind the <unk> <unk> I didn't see it <unk>
People in the <unk> <unk> are <unk>
Let me show you <unk>
This is really my <unk> It's not a <unk> <unk>
This is my <unk> and I can <unk> <unk>
<unk> if you <unk> <unk> you look on the other side.  I don't <unk>
People in the bottom or <unk> a few years a video --  <unk> <unk> is clear that <unk> <unk> a few <unk> but if it was true <unk>
you see there is a hole here and a hole here, if it was real <unk>
Well, I'm going to go out a little bit of a <unk> for you.
That's here.
<unk> now <unk> <unk>
<unk> my <unk> and I'm going to show you that there are no <unk>
But I think in this context -- I think in this context and the idea of taking something <unk>  and <unk> in something <unk>
<unk> many times in the next few days  I hope you don't <unk> Thank you very much.
So, in my life I met a lot of <unk>
I've only <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> is more than another one story.
It was a <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> one of the <unk> on the <unk>
What <unk>
What <unk>
So, you're going to place with the <unk> in the <unk>
I've been <unk> in a relationship with this beauty for several <unk>
One day, the <unk> <unk> me to talk about a <unk>  <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk>
This was a <unk> that <unk> to solve  what is a <unk> problem for our <unk>
How do we continue to have the fish in our <unk>
<unk> the last 50 years -- we have <unk> in the <unk> in the same way that we <unk> the <unk>
The <unk> was <unk>
The <unk> of the great <unk> the ones that <unk> us so much -- the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the
There's almost <unk>
So, we <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of our future.
There's a lot of <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> fish for less the biggest part of <unk>  and are <unk> <unk> for <unk>
A great problem is that there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
That means that it takes 15 <unk> <unk> to get a <unk> of <unk> <unk>
It's not very <unk>
And the <unk> is not a great <unk>
So here here we finally had <unk> that <unk> to do it in the right way.
I wanted to <unk>
The next day --  I <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> I said, <unk> to figure out good, you are <unk>  to make <unk> <unk> <unk> that don't <unk>
<unk> said, <unk> so <unk> from the <unk>  that our <unk> are <unk>  not <unk>
And then <unk>  <unk> basically a world of <unk>
"The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"The best <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> to a <unk> What does it <unk> to eat to <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
That <unk> I was in <unk> <unk>  but <unk> is a <unk> <unk>
So the next day a little <unk> before the <unk> still <unk>
<unk> <unk> You do some example of <unk> <unk>
He said he didn't do it, and he was going to ask <unk>
Well, let's start with a little bit of people <unk>  and no one <unk> <unk>
<unk> finally <unk>  with the <unk> <unk>
He also <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, he <unk> a few <unk> a few <unk> <unk> <unk> and then said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> of your <unk> is made of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
"Well, it's about 30 <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> what is about <unk>  in giving the fish of the <unk> <unk>
There was a long <unk> on the phone and then said, <unk> are <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
I'm going to talk about this <unk>
No, not because I'm one of those <unk>  <unk> of good food and <unk>
Well, to say the truth <unk>
No, in fact I'm going to do that, because, I'll tell you --  after that <unk> the fish knew to <unk>
The second <unk> is <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> story --  that kind of story for which more <unk> the fish <unk>
I <unk> it for the first time in a <unk>  in the <unk> of <unk>
One of my <unk> <unk> told me about this <unk>
<unk> had done <unk>
<unk> on the <unk>  He had a <unk> white <unk> almost <unk>
The <unk> <unk> had this <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> than it had to be <unk>
It was still <unk>
Who is able to make a fish so <unk>  after the <unk> <unk>
I no,  but this guy <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
It's actually called <unk>
No, he didn't <unk> the <unk> and it's not a <unk>
To the <unk> not in the sense that the <unk> of <unk>
It's a <unk>  to <unk> The <unk> which is a <unk> of <unk> fish <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> to the <unk>  <unk> was <unk> by the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> on what was essentially a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> a series of <unk> <unk>  <unk> so water in the <unk>
Well, I couldn't do the thing  not to work from a <unk> <unk>
And from a <unk> point of <unk> was a <unk>
He had <unk> something like the <unk> <unk> and <unk> is a lot of <unk>
So, in <unk>  <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What do you do?
<unk> the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> of <unk> water out of the <unk>  <unk> the <unk> for <unk>
<unk> all the <unk>
<unk> a <unk> fish from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> and this <unk> <unk> <unk> and this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
I mean, it's never seen something like this.
<unk> <unk>  which seems to be far far from a million miles -- and all that <unk> are the <unk> <unk>  and this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I've been there a little time ago with <unk>
It's an incredible kind of three Charles <unk> Charles <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the middle of this <unk>  and I said, <unk> I had the <unk> to the <unk>  and I said, <unk> <unk> his <unk> <unk>
<unk> I <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then it <unk> me the <unk> of the <unk>  and then you see a kind of <unk> of <unk>  that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>
It turns out that <unk> <unk> a lot of his <unk>  at the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I asked them as a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> I don't know any <unk>
I'm a <unk> in <unk>
And then immediately after the <unk> <unk>  on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We didn't know this was very <unk> <unk>  something like the <unk> community <unk> to <unk>
<unk> is <unk> but I was <unk>
And my head <unk> to <unk>  at that <unk> <unk> I had <unk> the <unk> <unk>
So he <unk> and <unk>  <unk> which makes your fish so <unk>
He <unk> the <unk>
<unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>  The <unk> is <unk>
But your fish <unk>
<unk> your <unk> rate <unk>
Well, I <unk> <unk>  about how their <unk> is a system so <unk>  that the fish <unk> exactly what <unk> in a <unk> environment <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> the <unk>  The <unk> is all that <unk> the <unk>
The system is so <unk>  that <unk> <unk>
There are no <unk>
You've ever heard about a <unk> that doesn't give your <unk>
More <unk> I was <unk> around the <unk> with <unk>  and I said, <unk> a place like this -- it seems so <unk> --  -- how you do to measure the <unk>
At that <unk> moment, it was like <unk>  the <unk> of a film had <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> between the most <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk>  a real <unk> <unk> which <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> their <unk> are <unk>
They are <unk>
<unk> I was completely <unk>
<unk> <unk> but they're not <unk> with your <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> about the <unk> of the fish -- and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> year on this <unk>  There were <unk> <unk> -- more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> has become the largest <unk> and one of the most important --  -- <unk> <unk> for <unk> all over the <unk>
<unk> <unk> but a <unk> <unk> population is not the last thing that <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> no.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  not <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And so much more is <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is the <unk>
OK, so <unk>  A <unk> that doesn't give to your animals -- and that <unk> its own success in the <unk> to the health of its <unk>
A <unk> <unk> but also a <unk> for <unk>
<unk> to <unk> those <unk> <unk> should not even <unk>
<unk> the <unk> in a city --  -- <unk> miles -- where the <unk> conditions are <unk> for <unk> <unk>
Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and they get <unk>  and every <unk> you have <unk> <unk> miles per <unk>
They do it because they are able to follow  <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> something like the <unk> of <unk>  so <unk> <unk>
And I said, <unk> <unk> <unk>  to <unk> miles up to <unk>  and then <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They do it for their <unk>
I <unk> as if I had just <unk> a song of <unk> <unk>
<unk> "No, they do it because food is <unk>
I didn't know about the skin of my <unk>  which was <unk> and <unk> to me don't usually like <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't like <unk> <unk> I don't like <unk>
It's that <unk> as a <unk> <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk>
<unk> when I saw it in that <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>  didn't know for <unk> <unk>
He had a <unk> <unk> and <unk> was a <unk> <unk>
<unk> this to <unk> and he <unk>
<unk> "The skin is like a <unk>
It's the <unk> <unk> before any <unk> in the body of the <unk>
It's <unk> for <unk> <unk>
And then <unk>  <unk> our water doesn't <unk>
OK. A <unk> that doesn't <unk> its <unk>
A <unk> that just happened on the basis of the success of its <unk>
And then I realized that when he says,  that <unk> has no <unk>  <unk> the thing -- because the water that <unk> <unk>  -- because the water that <unk> <unk> <unk>  -- which is a <unk> that brings <unk> <unk> to the <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when you <unk> the system --  -- the water is more <unk> than when it's <unk>
The system is so <unk> <unk> <unk>
So, not just a <unk> that doesn't <unk> its animals --  not just a <unk> that <unk> its own success in the <unk> to the health of its <unk>  but a <unk> which is literally a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and not only for me and for you.
Because when the <unk> water goes <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> I know --  -- but I love the <unk> and so you should have to do you --  -- because this <unk> story as <unk>  is also <unk>
You might say that this is a <unk>  for the future of good food -- and <unk> <unk> <unk>
What we now need is  a <unk> <unk> new <unk> <unk> in which the food really has a good <unk>
But for many people,  this is a little too <unk>
We're not <unk> we <unk> of food.
We are <unk>
<unk> <unk> little <unk>
<unk> the little <unk> <unk>
<unk> food <unk>
<unk> <unk>
And when you think these are the things --  -- the future of good food --  <unk> <unk> <unk> to me <unk> and he says, <unk> <unk> even to me the <unk> <unk> <unk> but how do you think that you can <unk> the world <unk>
How do you think you can <unk> the <unk>
I can be <unk>
That's a question I don't <unk>
No, not because it <unk> already --  more than <unk> enough to be able to <unk> the world.
One billion people <unk> the <unk> today.
One billion -- more than there have ever been --  because of the enormous <unk> in the <unk>  not for the <unk> <unk>
You see, I don't like this question because it <unk> the <unk> of our <unk> system over the last 50 years.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> and all this <unk> period of <unk> <unk>  said, "If we can <unk> more people in a more <unk> way --  -- what is it <unk>
This was the <unk>
It was the <unk>
It was the <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> for what is,  <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> which is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which makes <unk> <unk>
This is not <unk>  and it's not <unk>
Our <unk> today is <unk> not because of the <unk> in <unk>  but for the <unk> resources in <unk>  but for the <unk> <unk> <unk>  not for the <unk> but for the <unk> <unk> <unk>  not for the <unk> but for the <unk>  not for the <unk> but for the <unk>  and not for the <unk> but for the <unk> in the fish in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> in <unk> how we're going to <unk> <unk>
Or <unk> how can we create the <unk> <unk> that <unk> to every community <unk>  of <unk> if you <unk>
To do that,  We don't look at the <unk> model of the future.
It's a <unk> and <unk>
It was all about <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and it has never really produced anything <unk>
<unk> we look at the <unk> <unk>
This is what I <unk> on two billion years --
<unk> to <unk> <unk>  to <unk> like <unk>  to <unk> and <unk> which are not <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> if you <unk> <unk> --  -- instead of <unk> --  -- instead of <unk> --  -- but <unk> because they are the ones are not just <unk>  but <unk> because they are the ones are the <unk> in the <unk>
If I really have to be <unk>  they are better than ever <unk>
You know, I <unk>  because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be <unk>
Thank you.
I grew up with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>  <unk> back and <unk> every day.
And I was always <unk> in a book, a book of <unk> which I <unk> my mind in other <unk>  and <unk> in the form of <unk>  <unk> sense of <unk> that <unk>
And that <unk> also <unk>  in the fact that every time I was not in school --  I was outside the <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> them to the <unk>
I was a real <unk> of <unk>
But you always try to understand the world,  understanding the <unk> of the world as possible.
And my love for the <unk>  actually seemed to <unk> the world around me,  because what was happening in the <unk> years <unk>  we were going on the <unk>  We were going on the <unk>  We were going on the <unk> <unk> that we didn't even <unk>
So, it seemed to <unk>  my <unk> for <unk>
And I was a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> there were no <unk>  or this <unk> of <unk> <unk> to <unk>   I had to create these pictures in the <unk> of the <unk>  I had to create these <unk> in my head.
<unk> when you <unk> a book --  everybody <unk> through the <unk> <unk> <unk>  put something on the <unk> of our <unk>
And so, my answer was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all this <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> always <unk> <unk>  <unk> behind the book <unk>
That's because <unk>  had to find a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's <unk> <unk> <unk> programs -- the <unk> programs --  <unk> me very much for the fact that there was a <unk> world right on the <unk>
<unk> I would never go into a <unk> world,  on a <unk> <unk>
<unk> very <unk>
But that was a world where I could go to really, --  right here on Earth, the <unk> and <unk> of what I would ever imagine these <unk>
So, I decided that I would become a <unk>  <unk> 15 years.
And the only problem was that <unk> in a small country of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I haven't left my <unk>
I <unk> my <unk> until he got a school <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in New <unk>  just spent the <unk> from the <unk> where it <unk>
And so I managed to take the <unk>  in a <unk> <unk> in the middle of the <unk>  in New York <unk>
And I wouldn't have seen <unk> the real <unk> for the other two years --  until we <unk> in <unk>
<unk> then, in the <unk> <unk>  I <unk> about <unk> hours <unk>  and 500 of these hours in <unk>
And I learned that the <unk> <unk> --  -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> --  are <unk> of <unk> life, which is really <unk> beyond our <unk>
<unk> of the nature is without <unk>  than our <unk> human <unk>
<unk> today, I'm <unk>  -- from what I see when I do <unk>
And my story <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> than it ever <unk>
But when I got a <unk> <unk>  I <unk> to make <unk>
<unk> to be the best way to <unk>  this <unk> to tell stories -- this <unk> to create <unk>
And, by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on.
So <unk> was the only way to put together images and <unk>
All right.
And of course the stories I <unk> to tell --  were stories of <unk> <unk> <unk>  and <unk> <unk>
And with <unk> <unk> I <unk> my love --  -- for <unk> and <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk>
So, I <unk> the two <unk>
As a <unk> <unk> came up with something interesting -- which was it was to solve a <unk> <unk> problem.  in that <unk> <unk> -- that kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we have <unk> <unk> <unk> with the computer.
And so he was born the first <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> computers --  that had ever seen in a <unk>
And even though the film didn't do a lot of <unk>  I think <unk> is <unk>  I've been <unk> about something <unk>  I <unk> the public was <unk>  So the public was <unk> <unk>
You know, it's the law of <unk> <unk> <unk> that every technology <unk> <unk> is <unk> by the <unk>
You're seeing something <unk>
And this <unk> me a lot of <unk>
And I said, <unk> this is something that has to be <unk>  <unk> <unk>
So, with <unk> <unk> my <unk> <unk> we went to very <unk>
<unk> with the <unk> <unk> and <unk> we created the guy of <unk> <unk>  in that <unk> The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it <unk> And we created a <unk>
And we <unk> the same result with a <unk>
But we have <unk> a little bit more with that <unk>
So, <unk> a line between these two <unk> <unk>  I came to the <unk> that this would have been a new world of <unk>  -- was a world all new <unk>
<unk> I put in a society with <unk> <unk>  my <unk> friend <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that was the main <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> in that <unk> and called <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> of the society was <unk> to <unk> the <unk> the <unk>  the <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on, and go directly to the <unk> <unk>
And so we did and gave us a <unk> <unk> for a <unk>
But we went back to half of the <unk>  in the <unk> part of <unk> <unk> and <unk> which is what we had <unk> <unk>
So, I wrote this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  with <unk> human <unk> on the <unk> <unk>  with <unk> human <unk> and <unk> <unk>  <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> and the world <unk> to the computer.
And the whole thing was <unk> to <unk>
The <unk> of the society told me  that we were not able to do it for a <unk>
So, I did this <unk> and I did this <unk> of a <unk> <unk> that I <unk>
And I saw it in there as a <unk> and <unk> on a <unk>
<unk> a <unk> story <unk> <unk>  a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> what I wanted to do was <unk> to see the <unk> of the <unk>
That's why I did that <unk>
And it's the <unk> The study don't know.
But I said,  I said, <unk> <unk> to the <unk> I <unk> it from the <unk>
I <unk> it for <unk> <unk>
<unk> very important. <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk>
And I <unk> them to <unk> a <unk>
It looks like <unk> But this <unk> us back to the <unk>  <unk> that creates <unk>
Because we have really created a <unk> and six months later --  I <unk> on a <unk> <unk>  at two miles an <unk> <unk> of the <unk>  to look at the real <unk> -- not in a <unk> <unk> but <unk>
I was <unk>
And it took a lot of <unk> we had to build <unk> <unk> and <unk> and a lot of other things.
But I was <unk>  from those <unk> <unk> was like a <unk> <unk>
where everything was <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> huge <unk>
I'm going to tell you in this <unk> you go down into this <unk>  <unk> environment where there are no <unk> to be <unk>  that you can't go back to the <unk>
And I said, <unk> It's like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's really <unk>
And so, I was <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Of course, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was <unk>
It was <unk> It was <unk>
And it was an experience that  <unk> couldn't <unk> me.
Of course I could imagine a <unk> and --  to create a <unk> <unk> But I couldn't imagine what I <unk>  <unk>
<unk> our <unk> <unk> I saw <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> things I had never seen before,  -- things that I had never seen before,  which nobody had seen before,  -- which was not even <unk> by science --  <unk> in which we've <unk> and <unk>
So I was all from this  and I had to do more.
So I got a <unk> <unk>
And after the success of <unk>  I said, <unk> <unk> on the part of my <unk> work --  -- and I do <unk> with time for a little <unk>
So, we started to <unk>  these <unk>
We <unk> to go to the <unk>  and <unk> with <unk> <unk>
We're <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>
We took little robots that we had created  with the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
And the idea was to go into and make a <unk>  <unk> of <unk> which had never been done.
No one had ever <unk> within the <unk> They didn't have the <unk> to do it.  So we created the technology to do it.
So <unk> <unk> on the <unk>  <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in a <unk>  <unk> the <unk> that <unk> just like <unk>  where I knew they had <unk> <unk>
And I'm <unk> a little <unk> <unk> through the <unk> of the <unk>
When you do that, I'm <unk>  but my mind is in the <unk>
It seemed to me to be <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>
And it was <unk> <unk> <unk> --  more <unk> than ever <unk>  because I knew what it would have been <unk> before <unk> --  -- because I had <unk> the <unk> for the <unk> <unk>  -- because I had the <unk> for the <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
So it was absolutely <unk> <unk>
And it really makes me that <unk>  <unk> of the <unk>  that you can <unk> through these <unk> <unk>  The mind is <unk> in <unk> <unk>  in <unk> form of <unk>
It was really <unk>
And it could be a little <unk> of what it might <unk> <unk> between some <unk>  -- when you try to have <unk>  for <unk> or for the other <unk> --  -- the <unk> <unk> --  -- I can <unk> that <unk>
So, we did these <unk>  and started to actually <unk> what was there was <unk> -- like the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>  where these animals were <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk> right here on the <unk>
<unk> in a <unk> <unk>
We don't <unk> in a system -- <unk> on the light of the sun as we do.
So, you see animals that live close to <unk> <unk> <unk>  500 <unk>
<unk> even <unk> that <unk>
<unk> at the same time --  I was <unk> a lot of science --  again, is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
And I ended up <unk> <unk> <unk>  really <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>  to go to the <unk> <unk> to go to the <unk> <unk> <unk>  -- and all these things --  -- to fly to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with our <unk> <unk>
It was <unk>
But what I <unk> to do was to take the <unk> scientists with us in the <unk>
And you get it down because you have <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> people <unk> these <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> down and <unk> them and <unk> and <unk> and so forth.
So, we were looking at the <unk>  but actually <unk> the <unk> science <unk>
I had <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- to do those things really <unk>
And you know, in this <unk>  I learned a lot of <unk>
I learned a lot of <unk> But I also learned a lot about <unk>
They all think a <unk> should be a <unk>  the <unk> of <unk> or something like that.
I didn't know anything about <unk>  before I do all those <unk>
Because I had to say,  "What am I doing here <unk>
Why am I doing that? What are I <unk>
<unk> nothing to do all these <unk>
<unk> we go to the <unk> We go to <unk>
People think about almost it went to  <unk> between <unk> and <unk> and <unk> me the <unk> <unk>  <unk> on a few <unk>
I did all these <unk> all these <unk>  for a public <unk>
<unk> <unk> no <unk> no money. What am I <unk>
I'm doing this for the <unk> in <unk>  for the challenge --  -- and <unk> is the largest challenge that <unk>  for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>  and for the <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- when a small group of people form a team <unk> <unk>
Why do we do that?
<unk> at the <unk> for <unk> months of <unk>
And in that <unk> you realize  is the important thing is that you have for them --  is the <unk> that you have for them to <unk> when you <unk> a <unk>  that you can't tell any more.
When you go to <unk> and you <unk>  <unk> you should do this, and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>  and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>  -- the <unk> <unk> of human <unk> when you work in <unk>  I don't do that <unk> It's the thing that you may have only <unk> or the <unk> that we never <unk>
<unk> a <unk> to create a <unk> of <unk>
When I am <unk> to make my <unk> <unk>  I tried to <unk> the same <unk> <unk> <unk>  I tried to <unk> the same <unk> of <unk>  <unk> the team -- and in <unk> <unk> their <unk>
It's really <unk> the <unk>
And so <unk> again, one time with a little <unk>  in <unk> <unk> <unk>  to do <unk> with new technologies that didn't know before.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
And we came up with a <unk> <unk> of four and <unk>
And it completely changed my way to <unk>
People say, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and I got the <unk> <unk> <unk> and I put them on the <unk>
For me, it was the <unk> of <unk>  the process in <unk> which was <unk>
What can we <unk>
What are the <unk> we <unk>
I think the first is <unk>  <unk>
It's the most powerful thing I do.
<unk> is a <unk>  that can actually <unk> a <unk>
And the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is more important than all the <unk> in the world.
<unk> <unk>  I come to me and say, <unk> some <unk> to make <unk>
And I said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> people will <unk> for you, not <unk> by <unk>  I don't <unk> against you <unk>
And I said, <unk>
<unk> you always say this <unk>  <unk> is not <unk>
But <unk> has to be <unk>  <unk> and <unk> because it's like a <unk> in the <unk>
And no important <unk> --  that <unk> <unk> was made without <unk>
They could be <unk> to <unk> these <unk>
This is the thought that I want to <unk>  <unk> that in whatever it <unk>  <unk> <unk> is <unk>  But it <unk> no. Thank you.
If you could figure out a single idea of understanding --  -- it would be the <unk> of data --  -- is bigger than the <unk> of its <unk>  And instead of thinking about <unk>  I would like to show you how to use <unk> to make new <unk> <unk>
Here you can see some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk>
This tool I use is a little <unk>
It's called <unk> and with <unk> I can <unk> a single cause of <unk> we say <unk>
And immediately we see <unk> new <unk>
The reason is that there in the central part of the central part of the <unk>  and here instead of more <unk>
We can do a step back and we <unk> the data for <unk>  We see that <unk> <unk> and cancer are the major <unk> but not for <unk> <unk>
If we go on and <unk> to <unk> we say <unk>  We see the <unk> are <unk>  We see the <unk> are <unk>  We see the <unk> of death <unk>
<unk> <unk> is true for <unk>
So you have understood --  that <unk> information and data in this way, is a little bit like <unk>  in a sea of information <unk>
And if we can do it with <unk> <unk>  because not do it with <unk>
So for example, here we have  the <unk> of any <unk> <unk> <unk>
All of it all over here.
You can <unk> in your <unk> and <unk>
With <unk> you can look at a <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk>
You can <unk> a number in <unk>
For example, let's take the <unk>  which <unk> in this <unk> their <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> so I'm going to be here --  and I see all the numbers --  -- and I see all the numbers --  -- and I see all the numbers --  -- and I see all the numbers --  -- and I see all the numbers --  -- and I see all the numbers
Now, if I want to <unk> <unk>  I could think -- I could think --  "Why don't you know, why don't we <unk> <unk>
<unk> a step back and <unk> the <unk>
And I see <unk> <unk>
You have understood that when you <unk> the information in this way --  <unk> from the <unk> or <unk> away away from the <unk>  is not just a <unk> it's the <unk>
But you do something <unk>
It's a half a <unk> that we <unk> <unk> as we can use <unk>
<unk> still this idea that it may seem a little <unk>
We took every single page of <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it to a little <unk>  that <unk> in a small <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I'm just going to show you the first of 500 
Even in this <unk> <unk> we can do a lot of <unk>
They just <unk> what <unk> <unk> are the most <unk> on <unk>
At this point they <unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk> this <unk>  We see the <unk> of <unk> <unk>  more often <unk> to this voice is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> because it does <unk>  something that in <unk> <unk> <unk>
And you can see it just --  -- doing a step back to see the <unk>
If you <unk> one of these <unk>  I can then <unk> on the <unk>  <unk> of <unk> <unk>
and <unk>
At this point, I see most of the <unk> <unk> <unk>  Some of the world of science --  A number <unk> from the world of <unk>
That's my <unk>
One is from <unk>
And pretty <unk>  <unk> <unk> also <unk> a TED TED <unk>
So I can see all the <unk> of the TED <unk>
For the first time we're really <unk> in the web -- as if it was a <unk> not page <unk>  but at a level of <unk> <unk>
And I want to show you another thing that could <unk>
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> this <unk> --  I don't call it a <unk> because it's not a <unk>  but you need to see <unk> --  we <unk> this technology for <unk>  -- we <unk> this technology for <unk>   <unk> like this.
I can do a step back and I can go back to a <unk> <unk> <unk>  This is important because we just see the <unk> so --  -- I can see all my <unk> so --  -- that way.
I can <unk> on what I've done  in <unk> <unk>
In fact, you see the <unk> state of the <unk> <unk> I just <unk>
I can kind of <unk> other things I've seen in <unk>
If I want to do a step back and see all  I can do <unk> my <unk> or the <unk> of my <unk>
<unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> here to <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I can <unk> on my page on my <unk>  and I just <unk> up here.
A <unk> <unk> many times -- and in any case, the result is more than the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> in the world,  the data is <unk> as a kind of <unk>
It's about <unk> <unk>
It's about <unk> in the data.
And if you <unk> it all <unk>  -- if you <unk> the web <unk> --  -- instead of getting from many things to a lot of other --  -- and then you can see those <unk>  that <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then instead of <unk> <unk> in the data -- we could really <unk> <unk>
<unk> of <unk> <unk> -- we can <unk> out of the <unk>
And from knowledge maybe you also have to the <unk>
And with that <unk> you.
And all of these days talk about <unk>
I asked to <unk> the number of books -- the word <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> in the last five years, they have <unk> <unk> <unk> after <unk> <unk> and they were many more.
There is a huge <unk> <unk> on the <unk> in the <unk>
There's a lot of <unk>  on the <unk>
<unk> <unk> people <unk>
But <unk> all this <unk> of work,  There are a series of <unk> <unk> <unk> that make <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ideas on the <unk>
My talk today about <unk> especially <unk> <unk>
And it's about <unk> people who think about their <unk> --  -- and it's about <unk> that <unk> the <unk> --  -- because the <unk> that we are <unk> as all of others.
The first of these <unk>  is the <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> in fact, that the word happiness is not a <unk> word <unk> as a <unk> <unk>
I think you can <unk> to a particular meaning --  -- but in <unk> <unk> <unk> of this <unk> <unk> <unk> of this <unk>  and <unk> <unk> the <unk> vision of that is <unk>
The second <unk> is the <unk> between experience and <unk>  basically is to choose between being happy in life -- and be happy of your life.  or happy about your life.
And these are two extremely <unk> <unk> -- both part of the concept of <unk>
And the third --  is the <unk> of the <unk> -- the fact that we can't think of any <unk>  that <unk> on the <unk>  without <unk> <unk>
I mean, it's a real <unk> <unk>
and there's no way to do the right thing.
I would like to start with an example of one person that, after a <unk> of questions and <unk>  after a story.
<unk> you don't <unk>  <unk> that as you <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then it <unk> very <unk> <unk> that had <unk> the whole <unk>
But it was not true.
What was the <unk> was <unk>
He had lived <unk>
And it had <unk> for 20 minutes of the music <unk>
but that was not <unk>  because he <unk> with a certain <unk>  The <unk> was <unk> and I remember it was everything that <unk>
What this <unk> tells us in <unk>  is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two <unk> <unk>
There is a <unk> that lives in the present  and it <unk> the <unk> and it is able to <unk> the <unk>  but it basically has only the <unk>
It's about the <unk> that lives the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> --  -- you know when the <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when you <unk>
And then there's the <unk> that <unk> <unk> --  -- the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the history of our life,  and is that <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> "How are you heard in the last <unk>
or <unk> <unk> went to <unk> or something <unk>
<unk> are two <unk> <unk>  the <unk> that lives and what if the <unk>  and <unk> between the two is part of the <unk>  on the <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> is a <unk>
And this process starts with a fundamental answer of our <unk> --  starts <unk>
We don't just talk about the stories of <unk>
Our <unk> tells us about our <unk>  <unk> what our <unk> is a story.
Let me start with one example.
This is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of two patients in a <unk> <unk>
I didn't <unk> it in <unk> It's not even <unk> a day <unk>  but it was <unk> when this study was <unk> in the <unk>
They <unk> to the patients of <unk> their <unk> every <unk>
And here is the results for two <unk>
What are their <unk>
If you <unk> <unk> Who has two <unk> <unk>
It's a very simple question.
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
his <unk> <unk> of more  and for every <unk> of pain <unk> from the patient to <unk> it has <unk> at least as much as a <unk> or more.
But now there's another <unk>  <unk> these patients think they <unk>
and here's the <unk>  <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of the <unk> were different -- the one part of the <unk> of the <unk> is the way that <unk> --  -- no stories is particularly <unk> --  -- one of the two is very <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> is the <unk>  where the pain was <unk> at the time.
It's a <unk> story.
How do I <unk>
Because we asked these people after the <unk>  and also <unk> <unk> of time,  <unk> <unk> How <unk> has been <unk>
and <unk> <unk> for a long <unk> for <unk> in the <unk>
So this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> between the <unk> which lives and the <unk> that the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So, what you could do for the patient <unk>  and we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and it was really done, and it could <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This <unk> a little bit of pain in the <unk>  but just a <unk> and much less than before.
And by doing this for a couple of minutes,  the <unk> that lives in the <unk> of the <unk> At <unk> <unk>  and the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> At very <unk>  because the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk>
How do you <unk> a <unk>
And this is true for the stories --  -- which is from the <unk>  -- which <unk> the stories that <unk>  What a story, is the <unk> changes --  What a story, is the <unk> <unk> and the <unk>
The <unk> are very, very important <unk> in this case, the <unk> has <unk>
So, the <unk> that lives <unk>  lives its <unk>
It <unk> when it lives <unk> that they <unk>  And you ask what happens to these <unk>
And the answer is simple.
I <unk> to say that most of the <unk> of the <unk> of our life --  -- to how I <unk> them -- I mean about three <unk> --  -- how I think about three <unk> --  -- which means that in a <unk> <unk> million <unk>  In a month if we <unk> about <unk> it about <unk>  In a month if about <unk> about <unk>
Most of them are completely <unk> by the <unk>
And it somehow you have a sense that it should be <unk>  that what happens in these <unk> of experience is our life.
It's the <unk> resources that we're <unk> <unk> as we are in this world.
And as a <unk>  <unk> <unk> but that's not the story --  -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> for us.
So we have a <unk> that we have a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> that lives --  which are pretty <unk> <unk>
The largest difference between two  is like <unk> time.
The other point of view of the <unk> that lives the <unk>  if you go into <unk>  and the second week is <unk> as much as the first first first --  then the <unk> of two weeks -- the best of the <unk> of a <unk>
But this is absolutely not the way it works <unk>
The <unk> that <unk> a <unk> of two weeks --  is <unk> better than a week of a week of <unk>  because there's no new <unk> in <unk>
You don't have changed the story.
And in this way,  the time is <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that <unk>  -- from the <unk> that <unk>  -- from the <unk> <unk> --
The time has a <unk> <unk> on this story.
<unk> the <unk> that <unk> <unk> is more than <unk> and <unk>
It's actually the itself that takes <unk>  because, if you <unk> a patient who <unk> for instance,  -- two <unk> with two different <unk> and it's <unk> which he <unk>
The <unk> that lives the experience of <unk>  has no voice in these <unk>
In fact, we're not going to <unk> <unk>  but the <unk> of those <unk>
And even when we think about our future,  <unk> we don't think about our future as <unk>
<unk> to our future -- as a <unk> <unk>
In fact, you can <unk> this <unk> --  -- like a <unk> <unk> --  -- and you can think of the <unk> that <unk> as if you <unk> the <unk> lives the <unk>
I have a feeling that <unk> when we go to <unk>  you often get the case that  <unk> in good part of our <unk>  in good part of our <unk> <unk> that we <unk>
And this is a little hard to <unk>
<unk> how much <unk> our <unk>
This is one of the <unk>  which is <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk>
When I think about that, when I think about that, I think about a few years ago,  which is one of the best <unk> of my life,  and I think about <unk> --  -- and I think <unk> --  -- and I think about <unk>  -- and I think about <unk>  --
And I probably had to think about the <unk> of that journey of three <unk> per <unk>
If I ever opened the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of <unk>  I would have <unk> another three weeks -- I would have a three weeks of the journey --  It looks like there is a <unk>
<unk> I could be a little <unk>  in my <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of <unk>  but even if you <unk> more than that,     a question <unk>
Because we take a lot of <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> we <unk>
Now I want you to <unk>  to an experiment with <unk>
Imagine that during the <unk> <unk> <unk> that at the end of the <unk>  all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> for <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> the same <unk>  And if you were to choose a <unk> <unk>  you create a <unk> between the two <unk>  and you have to think about how to solve that <unk>  and it's not so <unk> --  -- if you think in terms of time --  -- then you've got a <unk>
And if you think in terms of <unk>  you might get another <unk>
The <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> is a problem that puts us in front of <unk>   <unk> <unk> between <unk> <unk>
<unk> two <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> actually two <unk> of <unk>  that we can <unk> one for every <unk>
So you can <unk> How <unk> is <unk> <unk>
And then you can <unk> How <unk> are the <unk>  in the <unk> life that lives the <unk>
And it's about <unk> happiness for <unk>  it's a <unk> process.
What are the <unk> that we can <unk>
And <unk> now we are able to make a pretty good idea of happiness -- the <unk> that lives in time.
If you look at the happiness of <unk> that <unk>  is a completely different thing.
It's not how <unk> a person <unk>
It's about how <unk> or <unk> is the person --  -- when he thinks his life.
It's a very <unk> idea.
<unk> not be able to <unk> these two <unk> --  is not going to be able to <unk> these two <unk> <unk> in the studies of <unk>  -- which <unk> the <unk> on happiness for a long time in this <unk>
The difference between happiness --  -- the <unk> that lives the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> has been <unk> in the last few years, and there are now <unk> to measure the <unk> two <unk>  <unk> has been <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk>  where over half a million people --  -- have been <unk> to a <unk> on what they think about their life and <unk>
And there were other studies in this <unk>
So in the last few years, we started to <unk>  on happiness about two <unk>
And the biggest <unk> we <unk>  is that they are very <unk>
You want to know how much a person is <unk> with your life,  and <unk> it doesn't tell you very <unk> about how much <unk> <unk> your life -- and <unk>
To give you an idea of <unk>  the <unk> is about <unk>
which means that if you <unk> <unk>  and you <unk> his father is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> something about his <unk>  but with a lot of <unk>
It's always a little bit of <unk>
If I tell you that somebody thinks that his life thinks that his life is at eight <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> on how <unk> they are  with their <unk> lives the <unk>
So the <unk> is <unk>
We have a certain knowledge of what we <unk>  the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
We know that money is very <unk>  The <unk> are very <unk>
We know that it means to be <unk> with the people who <unk> us <unk>  <unk> of time with people who <unk> us.
There are other <unk> but these are the <unk> <unk>
So if you want to <unk> happiness about two <unk>  -- -- <unk> -- things --  -- things <unk>
The <unk> of what I said, <unk>  is that we should not think about happiness -- as a <unk> <unk>
This is two different <unk>
<unk> very <unk> <unk>  is another reason why we can't think about happiness <unk> to happiness <unk> -- is that not <unk> attention to life, and when you think about life, and when we live in life.
<unk> if you ask the simple question about how happy people in <unk>  I don't <unk> to get the <unk> <unk>
When you do this <unk>  You think that you should be <unk> in <unk>
What happens is that <unk> when you think about life in <unk>  you're thinking about the <unk> between <unk> and other <unk>  and other <unk> <unk> and other <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and other <unk> <unk> and <unk> and other <unk> and <unk> <unk> and other <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and other <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and other <unk> <unk> and other <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> is not so important for <unk> that <unk> is not so important for the <unk> that <unk> and it's not very important for <unk> that <unk>  which is what <unk> as happy are the people.
But <unk> the <unk> that <unk> is in <unk>  you could end up -- some people <unk> at the end,  <unk> in <unk>
And it's interesting to <unk> what it <unk> to people --  who <unk> in the hope to be more <unk>
<unk> the <unk> that lives the <unk>  <unk> no longer <unk>
<unk>
But one thing that was the <unk> of being <unk>  because when you <unk>  <unk> than it was the time in <unk>
And I thought I took the <unk> <unk>
It's very hard to think about <unk> --  to think about <unk>  -- and I think I gave the idea of how hard it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for <unk>
Thank you very much.
When we were at the phone a couple of weeks ago,  I asked me that a very interesting <unk> which is a <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk>
It's something that you think you can share  because we still have a few <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And I believe that the most interesting <unk> that we found in the <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> that <unk> us of <unk>
We found that, with <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> that lives <unk>
When we have <unk> like <unk>  <unk> with the <unk> we found that, in the <unk> we found that, in a <unk> study on a <unk>  on a <unk> study on a very <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk>  It's about <unk> <unk> <unk>  It's about <unk> <unk> <unk>
CA: <unk>  <unk>  <unk> <unk> dollars <unk> people are <unk>  and become <unk> more <unk> <unk> as they become more <unk> <unk>  And they get a <unk> <unk>
I mean, I've seen the lines so <unk>
<unk> what happens is --  that money doesn't <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  but the <unk> of course, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and we can measure that <unk>  very, very <unk>
In terms of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> --  is all another story.
More money you <unk> <unk>
This talk is not about <unk>
CA: But <unk> all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>  life, <unk> the research of the <unk>
If people are <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all the way we have <unk> for example, the <unk> on the <unk> and so on.
<unk> the possibility that the <unk> and the country in <unk>  can take a <unk> like that <unk>  and take a <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk>
<unk> <unk> I think it <unk>  the role of happiness in <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> in the United States -- there's no <unk>  but in the <unk> is becoming <unk>  and other <unk>
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness --  -- when they think about <unk> <unk>
You get a little <unk> and the people are going to <unk>  if they want to study the <unk> of happiness or whether they want to study the <unk> of life --  -- that we need to start this <unk> to the <unk> <unk>
How do you <unk> the <unk>  takes different <unk> on how you <unk>  and <unk> that you think about the <unk> that you think of the <unk> that you think of the <unk> that you think <unk> or the <unk>
All of this <unk> the <unk> I think, in the <unk>
In the United States, they're doing <unk>  to measure the <unk> of happiness <unk>
And that, I think, <unk> <unk> to <unk> by the next <unk> maybe two --  of the <unk> <unk>
CA: <unk> it seems to me that this <unk> <unk> or unless it should be <unk>  the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the next few years.
Thank you very much for <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about energy and <unk>
It may seem <unk> because  in my work at the <unk> I <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk>  things to <unk> and <unk> the world -- to help the two billion more <unk> to live <unk> lives.
But the <unk> and <unk> actually, are extremely important to this people,  <unk> are more important to them than for anyone else in the world.
A <unk> <unk> for many years, <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> or too <unk>
<unk> things <unk> in ways that their <unk> environment simply can't <unk>
which leads to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> will be for them <unk>
The <unk> cost is, for them important.
In fact, if you <unk> the price of one thing <unk>  to reduce the <unk> <unk> of a long <unk>
The <unk> price is <unk> over time.
And a <unk> <unk> through the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk>
And even in the <unk> century we have <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> price <unk> because we have <unk> <unk>  we can create <unk> materials and do so many things.
So in the <unk> world we are as <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
But as the <unk> price for example of <unk>  We have to <unk> a new <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> is <unk> the planet, and its <unk> is very simple.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> causes a <unk> of <unk>  that <unk> very <unk>
<unk> on the <unk> and maybe even <unk> <unk> <unk> in the sense that the <unk> <unk> cannot <unk> to these  <unk> changes and so <unk>
The <unk> of how much you <unk>  -- the temperature because of a <unk> of <unk>  and like the <unk> of the two things are <unk> -- it's not very <unk>
And there's certainly <unk> on how much <unk> will be <unk> --  -- but they will be extremely <unk>
I often asked the best <unk> <unk>  We really need to reduce the <unk> almost <unk>
We can't only think about half or a <unk>
And the answer is, until we get almost to <unk> the <unk> temperature at <unk>
It's a great <unk> <unk>
It's not like to say, <unk> you a <unk> <unk> <unk> under a <unk> <unk>
It's not about <unk> a <unk>
It's about <unk> to <unk>
Now, we <unk> a lot of <unk> every year, over <unk> billion <unk>
<unk> 20 <unk> for every <unk>
For <unk> <unk> countries is less than a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The world's media is about five <unk> <unk> <unk>
And somehow we need to do <unk>  that <unk> the amount of <unk>
<unk> are <unk> <unk>
Just a few <unk> <unk> changed this <unk> so we have to go through through the <unk> <unk> to <unk>
This <unk> has four <unk>
It's a series of <unk>
We have the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> on the right is the <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and we see how can we <unk>
<unk> one of these numbers must be almost <unk>
It's the <unk> of <unk>
Let's have a <unk>
The first <unk> is <unk>
The world has <unk> billion <unk>
We <unk> to the <unk> <unk>
If we do a good job with the new <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>  We can <unk> <unk> <unk> 15 <unk> but here here <unk> a <unk> of about <unk>
The second <unk> are <unk> that we <unk>
which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They are <unk>  And the <unk> of poverty means for almost everybody in the world.
And it's a <unk> thing that this <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> world in the <unk> billion we could probably <unk> and use <unk>  But in <unk> every year, this number <unk>
And so, we <unk> the amount of <unk> <unk> <unk> is going to be more than <unk>
This is a very simple example of <unk>
<unk> you <unk> in your home <unk> to do the <unk>  but these <unk> so that they <unk>  and they <unk> their <unk> under the <unk> <unk>
How much do you <unk> And the energy to <unk> <unk> --  finally there is good <unk>
This <unk> is not <unk>
Thank you for a lot of <unk> new ways of <unk> --  -- for many <unk> you can <unk> <unk> <unk>
In some <unk> you can reduce the <unk>
There are other <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> or the <unk> <unk>  where the <unk> <unk> are very, very <unk>
So, <unk> in the better than the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But these first three <unk> <unk> <unk>  the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the best <unk> maybe <unk> billion <unk>
It's not <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk>  the <unk> <unk> the amount of <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>
The question is, we can <unk> <unk>
If you <unk> <unk> no.
If you <unk> gas <unk>
<unk> all the ways to produce today <unk>  on the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
What we're going to do on a <unk> <unk> <unk> is to create a new <unk>
And we need <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> I don't mean something <unk>
The <unk> is a <unk> The computer is a <unk>
<unk> and his <unk> are a <unk>
People today have <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of a lot of <unk>
We usually have a <unk>  a <unk> within which the <unk> <unk>
<unk> is <unk> and something <unk> <unk>
In this case, we have to drive all <unk>  and to make a <unk> in a very <unk> <unk>
I <unk> like <unk> this <unk>
There is some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> a year ago, when the <unk> of the <unk>  and people <unk> it.
We <unk> them <unk> <unk> in the world, there are people <unk> with <unk>
This is my idea for <unk>
I decided to fly <unk>  would have been <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here's <unk> <unk>
They tell me that they can't get out of the <unk>
<unk> we can <unk> <unk> like this,  but it's not going to be <unk>
We need <unk> a lot of <unk> or a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and very <unk> and <unk> is <unk> in a lot of <unk> --  -- I think only five <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I also give some <unk>  And if they can do more than I <unk> <unk>  but here I'm interested in <unk>  that <unk> work on <unk> <unk> of these <unk>  and not <unk> to <unk> how much <unk>  because all of the <unk> challenges of <unk>
<unk> for the first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or natural <unk>
So here here is a simple <unk> but it doesn't do it is,  and it's <unk> the <unk> after the <unk> <unk> from the <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> there are <unk> technologies that <unk> the 60 -- the <unk> of <unk>  but reach the <unk> <unk> is very <unk> and it's going to be very hard to <unk> <unk> on where all this <unk>
The <unk> <unk> is still the <unk> of the long <unk>
Who is <unk>
Who will <unk> something that is literally billions of times more <unk> than the nuclear <unk> like nuclear <unk> or <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk>
So it's a <unk> problem.
Another source would be <unk>
But also nuclear <unk> three big problems.
The <unk> especially in <unk> countries is <unk>
The question of <unk> the <unk> <unk> that nothing can go <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> and human <unk> and <unk> is not <unk> to be <unk> to <unk> <unk>
And then you get the <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> are <unk>
People need to be <unk>
<unk> very <unk> <unk> <unk> that you might be <unk>  and on which you should <unk>
The <unk> three of five <unk> I <unk>
They're the ones that people often <unk> <unk>
And to say the <unk> <unk> the great <unk> of not <unk> a <unk>  <unk> some <unk>
The first is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> with these technologies --  is <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of a central <unk>
It's about <unk> <unk> and then a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> these <unk> are <unk>
The sun will not <unk> the whole day, or all the days, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> if you <unk> from these <unk>  you have to find a way of <unk> energy.  <unk> when the source doesn't <unk>
<unk> <unk> us on the front of the <unk>
And on the <unk>
For example, let's say that this source <unk> is <unk>
So not only do you need technology,  but you've got to do the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> the <unk> problem.
To <unk> the size of the problem, I <unk>  all the kinds of <unk> <unk> today,  to <unk> <unk> <unk> of any <unk> --  -- I have <unk> with the amount of energy <unk> <unk> in the world -- and I found out that all the <unk> now could <unk> less than 10 minutes of all <unk>
So we really need a big step <unk>  a <unk> of 100 times than the <unk> now in <unk>
That is not <unk> but it's not very simple.
This problem is already <unk> when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 20 or 30 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then if you <unk> those <unk> for the <unk>  you need a <unk> <unk>
But as a <unk> on this <unk> <unk> is the right <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> What the <unk> could solve <unk>
Thank you very much.
We need at least a hundred people in each of these five <unk>
Many of them, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is good.
And I think here in the TED group --  -- a lot of people already have been working in these <unk>
Bill <unk> has several <unk> in which a <unk> called <unk> which <unk> great technologies in the solar <unk>
<unk> <unk> is <unk> in <unk> <unk> that are doing great things <unk> and have <unk> <unk> <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to all this.
<unk> <unk> and I are <unk> <unk> <unk>  that, <unk> you <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>
There have been some <unk> in the <unk> nuclear <unk> <unk>
But for a lot of time, the <unk> is <unk>  that there are some good ideas around it is not so <unk>
The idea of <unk> is that, instead of just the <unk>  the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we decided to <unk> even <unk> the <unk>  We decided to <unk> the <unk>  It's a <unk> idea in a certain sense.
For the truth if you talk about it for a long time, but it was never <unk> whether it would have <unk> or not, <unk>   You can do one <unk> and see that yes, with the materials that we <unk>
And the <unk> <unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You <unk> the <unk> and you use it as a <unk> --  -- the <unk> of <unk> today, which is <unk> from the problem that <unk> a <unk> <unk>
It <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk> It's a kind of <unk>
It's like a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> is called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The other point of <unk> the problem is <unk>
Here's a picture of a place in the <unk>
This is the <unk> <unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> which has been <unk> <unk> now as a <unk> <unk> and so it's called <unk> <unk> <unk>
These <unk> <unk> energy to the United States to <unk>
And <unk> the water of <unk> with a <unk> process.  there would be enough for the rest of this planet.
A lot of challenges <unk> <unk>  but this is an example of the hundreds of hundreds of ideas that we need to <unk>
How should we measure our <unk>
What <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and then <unk> the <unk> <unk>
You've heard a lot of people talking about a <unk> <unk> for the <unk>  It's really important to <unk>
The <unk> is going to be produced by <unk> <unk> and a little bit of <unk>
At that point, it <unk> we will have <unk> the <unk> and production of the <unk>
So you get to the <unk>  <unk> countries like <unk>  will have to <unk> completely their production <unk>
The only question is, we're <unk> this technology to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
We are also <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk>
It's a key <unk> of <unk>
<unk> that <unk> should have the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
Even that should have the same two <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to start getting <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> is going to be the amount of <unk>  and so the <unk>
But the <unk> in this <unk>  to do things that don't <unk> large <unk> has a <unk> only <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is the speed <unk> of new <unk>
We have to <unk> these <unk> to all <unk>  and we can measure the <unk> from the <unk> number of <unk> <unk> <unk>
Many <unk> books have been <unk> to <unk>
The book called <unk> "The <unk> and David <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These <unk> <unk> the problem and create a context in which <unk> the <unk>  because these things <unk> <unk> <unk>
Many things have to <unk> <unk>
I have a <unk> <unk>
A very <unk> <unk> <unk> technology <unk>
If you were to choose one <unk> for the next 50 years, <unk> <unk> to choose the <unk> of the country, the <unk> of a <unk> which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
If this <unk> for no <unk>  the <unk> between people who think of the <unk> and the <unk> between the United States and the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> between countries and <unk> the <unk> of those two billion people will be <unk> <unk> <unk>
What do we need to do, <unk>
What I'm telling you to take <unk> and <unk>
You need to get more <unk> to the <unk>
When the countries <unk> in places like <unk>  don't have to talk about <unk>
<unk> <unk> also the program of <unk>  and I'm going to tell you how much it <unk> <unk> in these <unk> <unk>
We need <unk> <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to <unk> the <unk>
We need to make this more <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> but I think <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you.
first of all, you can <unk> an idea of the size of the <unk>
Bill <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk>  <unk> all the big <unk> which we already <unk> --  -- only when it <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and even when we have <unk> the <unk> in a <unk> <unk>  to be <unk> that <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> of hundreds of <unk>
The difficult thing is to build the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>
Once we built the <unk> if it works like <unk>  is going to be a <unk> of <unk> because the <unk> the <unk> of energy -- are completely different from nuclear <unk> that we know today.
CA: So, if you <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> full of a <unk> <unk> full of <unk> <unk>
And then the process starts <unk> and <unk> to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> The <unk> today, are <unk> <unk>  A lot of people, many <unk> that can not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> things that <unk> and <unk>
It's not <unk>
If you look at the <unk> is very <unk> and you can get it for 60 years --  -- you get inside and <unk> all those <unk>
<unk> there, <unk> to <unk> and then <unk>
CA: A nuclear <unk>
<unk> Yeah. Well, the <unk> you can leave there --  -- then you can <unk> it into another <unk> and <unk>
And <unk> with the <unk> already <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or in <unk> near the <unk>
<unk> our first <unk>
So what was a problem of <unk> <unk> is going to be the <unk> of <unk>  and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- as <unk>
CA: But when you go around the world --  where you get more interest in the <unk>
<unk> Well, there is no place in <unk>  and there are all these interesting rules of <unk> on everything that is <unk> <unk> <unk>  So <unk> very <unk>
Our <unk> was in <unk> India, <unk>
I just met the <unk> for <unk>
We talked about how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They are <unk> <unk> and <unk> made of work in this <unk>
It's a <unk> on something that has been done.
It's a <unk> <unk> but it's a kind of <unk> <unk>  that many countries have already <unk>  And so everybody has built a fast <unk> is a good <unk> it's a good <unk> to <unk> the <unk>
CA: <unk> what are the time and the <unk> is <unk> that one thing like they <unk>
<unk> Well, for one of these projects on a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is the <unk> that the <unk> <unk>  <unk> to be <unk>
<unk> if all <unk> well, it's not <unk> <unk> <unk>  it could <unk> this <unk>
And now there are <unk> <unk> of companies in the <unk>  that <unk> if they <unk> to <unk> <unk>  if they <unk> for their <unk> <unk> will be <unk>  <unk> <unk>
And it's better if a lot of <unk> have <unk> because at that point you can <unk> a set of <unk>
We need to have at least a <unk>
CA: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is the greatest you <unk>
<unk> A revolution is the most important thing
It would also have been without <unk> <unk> but the <unk> <unk> make it much more important.
In <unk> <unk> there are other <unk>
We don't know their work well like this,  but one is the nuclear <unk> a different <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk> I think it's hard to <unk> but maybe they say the same thing of us.
There are <unk> <unk>  But the <unk> is that a <unk> of <unk>  <unk> a million times more energy than a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  So if you start to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>  So if you start to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>  does it almost a <unk>
CA: And if you don't understand what do you <unk>
We should not be able to start <unk> of <unk>  to try to keep the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> If you <unk> in that <unk>  is a little bit like when you <unk> <unk> <unk> and you're going to have a <unk> <unk>
Where do you get to that <unk> need a <unk> or something <unk>
There is a whole research on <unk> <unk> <unk> -- which are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 20 or 30 years in which <unk> <unk>
It's like a <unk> <unk>
<unk> not <unk>
Some people say you don't even have to work on the <unk>  because you might <unk>  <unk> to eat because the <unk> <unk> you <unk>
I don't think it's a <unk> <unk> view of the problem,  but now the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> if you could keep the solutions in case that <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> more <unk> than the <unk>
CA: <unk> if I had a <unk> or two to them,  like <unk> <unk> who have <unk>
<unk> Well, there are different kinds of <unk>  and the ones that <unk> <unk> <unk> are very <unk>
Some people say there is a <unk> <unk>  because of the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>
I'm very, very few things about the things that you can can only say  that there is a <unk> on a million that <unk>  Here the main problem of <unk>
<unk> a <unk> and we <unk> the <unk> just a lot later.
And so, when you're <unk> from a thousand <unk> <unk>  The idea of <unk> the <unk> only <unk>
<unk> <unk> not <unk>
In fact, the <unk> doesn't necessarily <unk> the case of the <unk> <unk>  There are people in the <unk> world looking at <unk>  and he says, <unk> it's not so <unk>
The fact is that the <unk> should be <unk>
But my <unk> is that, if we can <unk> <unk> <unk>  and to <unk> the <unk> on the <unk>  then the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> I don't care <unk>  <unk> me if I don't <unk> <unk> --  -- but <unk> because it's more <unk>
CA: It would be your answer to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that if you <unk> all your <unk> trying to solve the problem of <unk> <unk>  <unk> your other <unk> <unk> are going to be <unk>  And that <unk> <unk> when there are better things to do, <unk>
<unk> Well, the <unk> research and <unk>
we say <unk> should <unk> 10 billion more than the <unk> now --  is not so <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to other <unk>
The things that <unk> very <unk> and also people <unk> might <unk>  are the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For me, it's more <unk> I love it.
<unk> that you are not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to the point --  -- I think the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> technologies that have the potential to <unk> <unk>
If you <unk> <unk> <unk> energy <unk> so that only <unk> <unk> can <unk>  all the people in the <unk> they can pay five times as much as it without changing <unk>
The <unk> would be for those two <unk>
And <unk> <unk> has <unk> its <unk>
The <unk> now is, "Why don't you have more than <unk> and <unk>
For his <unk>  he still <unk> it between the <unk> <unk>  but he realized that it's a <unk> <unk> <unk>  and then it's <unk> the question of <unk> and <unk>
And it's a question that I think is <unk> <unk>
It's amazing how little <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>
CA: <unk> <unk> <unk> I think that's the name of the <unk> <unk>  saying that I hope you can see your <unk> to become <unk> Thank you.
<unk> Thank you.
I'd like to share with you a <unk> I did a few months ago  while I was doing a <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I always <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk> to my <unk> every time I <unk> something, but I had already <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>  And I realized that I had never in my life --  -- to see what I would <unk>
Let me show you the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> on a friend of mine and at the beginning --  -- it was so <unk> -- I had just <unk> the word <unk> my voice gets <unk>  and I had to <unk> it from the <unk> from <unk> and <unk> of these words <unk>
You know, we're talking about the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk>
I'm <unk> it's going to be a <unk> <unk>
But, actually, the <unk> <unk> was early <unk>
when I was looking at the schools -- and I was <unk> and I was <unk> and I <unk> what I <unk> out of my <unk>  and the world around me.
and <unk> <unk> because of God wasn't using the <unk> of <unk> at that time.
I mean, from this <unk> seems to be <unk> in a world -- that somebody like me --  like me -- like one who has nothing <unk> in any way for them --  -- to do today, are <unk> for <unk> and <unk>  that my life <unk>
So, I immediately went to see <unk> <unk> in the <unk>  <unk> to find a <unk> without <unk>
This is the <unk> version of <unk>
It's not much better.
I find the <unk> two words under <unk> particularly <unk>  <unk> <unk> and <unk>  So, it's not just <unk> the <unk>
is what we think about when you <unk> them with these <unk>
it's about the values of these words, and how do we <unk> these <unk>
Our vision of our language and our vision of the world -- and how we see other people.
In fact, a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> and that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was more <unk>  because say things in high voice the <unk> <unk>
So, what do we really want to take a person that's <unk> or a person with more <unk>
So, you can do something as simple as a <unk> a person, a <unk>  we could <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on their <unk>
Don't <unk> instead of <unk> for <unk>
One person like this, which opened the <unk> was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
His name is <unk> <unk>
<unk> whose <unk> <unk> <unk> was too hard to <unk> for the most of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> <unk> always <unk> <unk> <unk> and had a <unk> <unk> to work with children.
<unk> almost anything of the time that I did in <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had to do what the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>  with these <unk> <unk> <unk> in different <unk>  you know, to build the <unk> of <unk>
And I <unk> these <unk> more than everything.
I <unk> them very <unk> <unk>
And, you know, I knew already as a five years,  with the <unk> <unk> to try and <unk> out of these <unk>  <unk> <unk>
And one day, he came to one of my <unk>  <unk> and I <unk> these <unk>
And he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> you're a <unk> so <unk>  I think it <unk> to <unk> one of those <unk>
<unk> <unk> you <unk> 100 <unk>
Now, <unk> was just a little <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> that I didn't want to do the <unk> of being the <unk> of being the <unk> <unk> of being the <unk> of <unk>  <unk> what did did was to give a different <unk> <unk>
and <unk> in a interesting experience for me.
And I <unk> today, the <unk> of his <unk> -- and his <unk> about me as a <unk> <unk>  has <unk> my view of me as a <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the future.
This is an example of how <unk> with <unk> of power  can <unk> the <unk> of a <unk>
But, <unk> before with those <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> our language <unk> us from the possibility of <unk> to the reality that we all <unk>  -- the possibility of a <unk> to see if it as <unk>
Our <unk> has not been at the step with the <unk> of our <unk>  many of which have been <unk> by the <unk>
<unk> from a point of view --  -- my <unk> my <unk> my <unk> to <unk> <unk> and also <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>  that are <unk> people to <unk> with their <unk>  and <unk> to their <unk> --  -- and <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> --  -- the <unk> of the <unk> --  -- the <unk> of <unk> if you <unk> the people can <unk> their <unk> if they are so <unk> if they can <unk> if they can <unk> if they <unk> if they <unk> if they <unk> the <unk> the <unk> if they <unk> if they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> if they <unk> <unk> <unk>
So, perhaps the <unk> technology <unk> now more <unk> -- what's always been a <unk> -- that everybody has something <unk> and <unk> by <unk> our <unk> to <unk> our <unk>  and human <unk> of <unk> is our greatest <unk>
The human <unk> of <unk> is something interesting --  because people always wanted to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and I have to tell you <unk>
This <unk> I didn't do that well, and I was always <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> to answer people to this <unk>  and I think I'm trying to figure out <unk>
is <unk> in this <unk> <unk> <unk> --  is the idea that <unk> or the <unk> is a challenge without <unk> or <unk> of this <unk>  if my success in life has come from a <unk>   If my success in life came from a <unk>  And the <unk> of a <unk> life with <unk> or what people like my <unk>
In fact, we are <unk> <unk> we are <unk> by a <unk>  <unk> or <unk>
And I said, <unk> which is a good thing.
<unk> is not a <unk> that we have to <unk>  in a way to <unk> our life.
is part of our life.
And I began to think it's like my <unk>
<unk> sometimes you do that, and sometimes almost to <unk>  but it's always with me.
And, of course, we don't <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> of a person.
There are <unk> and the challenges in life,  and it's all true and <unk> to every single person,  but the question is not if you <unk> <unk> or not, or not, or not, or not, or not, or <unk> or not,
So, our <unk> is not simply to protect people to us from the <unk>  but <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> way.
And we do a <unk> give to our children  when we make them feel that they are not <unk> to <unk>
There is a important difference and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of being a <unk> person --  -- the <unk> <unk> of the society that <unk> me or not.
And in <unk> the only <unk> <unk> that I had to <unk>  is if the world has ever thought that I could be <unk> by those <unk>
In our <unk> to protect those who <unk>  <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> about their <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> the <unk> of their life,  to <unk> the <unk> of their <unk> <unk>  to be <unk> in a wall  that <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> model of just looking at what is <unk> in you <unk>  and how to <unk> it can <unk> more than the <unk> <unk>  that the disease <unk>
In not one person in the <unk>  I don't understand its <unk>  We're creating another disease <unk> to the natural <unk>
We're actually <unk> a <unk> to the value of a person in our <unk>
So we have to see through the disease  and within the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
and, much more <unk> there is a relationship between those <unk> <unk>  and our <unk> <unk>
So, it's not about <unk> or <unk> these <unk> research --  -- like something that we want to <unk> or below the <unk>  but rather finding those <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
So, maybe the idea that I want to explain is that  There is no thing as a <unk> <unk>  <unk> like <unk> <unk>  to use a <unk> <unk> <unk>  to use a <unk> <unk> <unk>  to use <unk>
And <unk> if you look at a <unk> like a natural thing and <unk>  And we're less <unk> from its <unk>
<unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of Charles <unk>  and it was <unk> years ago, when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I think, the truth about the human <unk>
To <unk> in another way, is not the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk>  and it's not even the most <unk>  is the one that <unk> to the <unk>
The <unk> is the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> work with <unk> between other things, we can recognize that  <unk> human <unk> of <unk> and <unk> is <unk> by the <unk> of the human <unk> through the <unk>  in <unk>
So, again, <unk> <unk> is our greatest <unk>
And, <unk> we're not <unk> we don't <unk> we know what we are <unk>
<unk> that's what gives us <unk>  A sense of <unk> a sense of your <unk>
So, we can make a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk>
Maybe we can see it as a <unk>
<unk> is a <unk> which we haven't yet <unk>
I think the greatest <unk> that we have <unk>  is this idea of <unk>  Now, who is <unk>
There is no <unk>  There's a <unk> there's a <unk> there's a <unk> there's no <unk>
And they said, <unk> those <unk> people <unk> if they <unk>
<unk>  I don't think <unk>
If you <unk> this <unk> from one of how to get the <unk>  on the <unk> or <unk> to be <unk> a little bit more <unk>  we can understand the force of so many children, and <unk> their <unk> <unk> with the <unk>
The <unk> told us that the thing that <unk> <unk> as <unk> we always wanted to the <unk> of our community -- is to be <unk> to be able to <unk>
There is a <unk> that in <unk> 60 <unk> years ago,  <unk> to the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> with <unk> <unk> and, perhaps through the <unk> of those people like <unk> or <unk> they were <unk> like <unk> or <unk> they were <unk> like <unk>  They were <unk> <unk> as <unk> and <unk>
A few years ago, I was in a <unk> <unk> <unk> in that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
and I was <unk> in front of a <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> and I had <unk> <unk> <unk>
I heard this <unk> his voice behind me <unk> <unk> <unk> is not <unk> <unk> <unk>  And I <unk> <unk> and there's this man of <unk> <unk> I didn't have any idea of <unk>
And I said, <unk> <unk> <unk> I don't remember the <unk> <unk>  He said, <unk> you don't <unk> <unk>
I mean, when we looked at you, I was doing it from the <unk> of your <unk>
<unk>  Oh, that <unk>
And I <unk> in fact, I <unk> a <unk>
That <unk> was the <unk> <unk> <unk> a man I had only known stories of my mother on that day,  because, <unk> <unk> are <unk> in two <unk>
And so, the <unk> <unk> of my mother had gone into <unk>  And so the man who told me <unk> was a <unk> <unk> for my <unk>
And <unk> I was <unk> without the <unk>  and I had my feet <unk> <unk> some <unk> in this <unk> and he had to be the <unk> <unk> this <unk> had to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
He said, "I had to give this <unk> to your parents --  that you never had the kind of <unk> that I never had the kind of <unk> that had the other children  or any kind of <unk> life -- and you gave me of the <unk>  <unk> The <unk> thing was that said to me about my <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I had <unk> with the <unk> <unk> you know, the <unk> of <unk>  I had <unk> my <unk> <unk> of <unk> or all my <unk> <unk> -- and I <unk> them <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the school school of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And it's called this part of the <unk> <unk> <unk>  The <unk> of human <unk>
<unk> <unk> can keep in <unk> than <unk> it can be  and how much <unk> in the quality of life of a person.
And the <unk> <unk> went to <unk>  and <unk> my <unk> unless he comes to <unk>  And even though it is <unk> a <unk> of <unk>  If it's just <unk> a <unk> of <unk>  if you <unk> a child <unk>
<unk> so the <unk> <unk> changed its <unk>
He understood that there is a difference between a <unk> <unk> and what everybody can do with <unk>
And there was a change in my <unk> I would say, when I was asked me when I was 15 years --  -- if I had the <unk> <unk> with <unk> and <unk> -- I wouldn't have a <unk>
<unk> that kind of <unk> at that time.
If I tell you, today, they are not <unk>
And it's because of the <unk> that I had with them,  not for the <unk> of <unk> that I had with them.
and, <unk> the change in me is <unk>  because I was <unk> more to people who <unk> me the door --  of those who <unk> me <unk>
You see, everything you need is a person --  that <unk> you <unk> the <unk> of your <unk> and you're <unk>  If you can give someone the <unk> of their <unk>  The human <unk> is so <unk> if you can do it -- and <unk> a <unk> for someone at a moment at a moment at a moment in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the word <unk> --  that <unk> <unk> out of what is <unk>  to <unk> the <unk>
So again, <unk> the potential that we want to <unk> <unk>
There was a case in the <unk> 60 in the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
It's called the <unk> in <unk> We call it here in the United <unk>
it means <unk> students <unk> from their <unk>
And the students with the best <unk> have a <unk> <unk> and teachers in the <unk> <unk>  well, they did it for a <unk> of three <unk> -- <unk> <unk> -- they made <unk> <unk> -- they said they were <unk> that they were <unk>
And at the end of this <unk> of three <unk> -- they were having some results at the level of <unk>  And <unk> the <unk> <unk> of this <unk>  and that took the students to <unk> the <unk> they said they were <unk>  And that's what happened at the end of the three <unk>
I thought they were interested in school, beyond what I had <unk>
The <unk> part of this was that the teachers were <unk>
The teachers didn't know that it was done this change --
The <unk> was said <unk> These are the students from <unk> and these are the ones with <unk>
And as they started to <unk>
So I think the real <unk> is to have a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> has no <unk>
It doesn't see the <unk>
It has no longer our <unk> <unk> <unk> and our <unk> ability to <unk>
if we can <unk> the human <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to <unk>  to see beauty in the same and the <unk> -- to be <unk> and <unk>  -- to be <unk> and <unk>  <unk> that we're using our <unk> force <unk>
When the <unk> has these <unk> we can create new <unk> and new ways of <unk>
I would like to end with a <unk>  <unk> from a <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> that made me know my friend <unk> <unk>
and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> only four <unk> --  <unk> <unk> child had known <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
