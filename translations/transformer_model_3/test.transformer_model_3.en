A few years ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a challenge to the marshmallow.
And it's very simple.
Grups of people who are doing that, you know, the most people who are going to go back to the people who are at the same time, a method of spaghetti sauce.
The marshmallow the marshmallow at the top.
And although it was very simply, because it gets to do it, because it costring people to collaborate very quickly.
And so I have to be interesting, and I ended up in a laboratory in a laborator.
And it was a success.
And from then, I got about 70 to the people who are doing this guy in the world with students, designers and architects even speakers and architects, even speaks and 50s.
I have something that reveals that revealing the lessons in collaboration, and they are doing some of these lessons with it.
In fact, the people start with the people starts with the equals to exequal.
They talk about it, you know, they would tell you that you might have the time planning time planning.
They make the slavery and prices.
They take a little bit of the time to discover the spectacular spaghetti sauce in structures, at the end of the time is to shmallow, and somebody out the marshmallow, and they shmallow, they do an either.
Ammiring the job of it.
But what they do is -- you know, you know, the "Ta-day" is that "Ta-day" because the weight of the marshmallow of the marshmallowing and collapses.
They have a lot of people who have a lot more times, "uh-h-h-tooh-blowed in the schools.
They cheating, cheating, and they create structures, and they create the structures,
And there are naturally people who have more structures that have more structures, there are the neodiplomed schools.
And it's incredible.
As Peter, not only create the highest structures, but they're also the most interesting structures.
And the thing is, how is it possible? What they do they do that?
And Peter to say, "I'm going to go back to the time when you go to the Spahetti sauce.
They don't spend time competing for the face.
But there is another reason for it.
And the one of them is that the people who are formed to the single best individual --
And then it exequals it.
And after that, what they do is that when they put the marshmallow on the top, they don't have any more and what happen?
The crisis.
They are familiar with familiar? Right.
You know, kids do differently, is that they start from marshmallow, and they build it prototypes, one after the marshmallow, they have a lot of people who are willing to train prototyping.
The designers who are doing this kind of collaboration is the essence of the relationships.
And with any versus that kids have an instant feedback on what it doesn't work.
So the people who are doing that, in fact, it's essential, but they do it.
The media for the people who are about 50 centries, for the people who are about 50 centuries, a little bit of it, but not speak, but they don't speak, but they don't speak, you know, a lot of adults.
Do they do it?
Architects and speaking it.
99 cm is the most people who are going to seen.
And why? Because you know that the triangles and the people who are the key to the revenues are the key for stable.
We have the general factors, a lot of media.
But they are interesting.
If you include a administrated administrator, you can do a lot of it.
It's unbelievable. You know, a little bit of it. You can see "Vedrays that people who are going to win advances. And why?
Because they have to be in the aggent jobs.
Gestables, I understand it.
And all of the people who are doing attention to the jobs at the jobs that they were very good at team.
And then the special dots and the combination leads to a little bit about it.
If you have 10 people who are going to do that, you're going to have maybe you're going to get it in the feet.
And I tried an expertise with it.
I thought, let's get the time for a time.
I have to say about the 10,000 people who were going to be in the next 10,000 people who are winning.
Do you think that it is to design?
Which was the job of that?
That's what happened.
And one of the teams have a teams --
If one of them had one of them to do that, 2.5 dinner, you know,
This is not that one of the people who are going to do it?
We tried to get the army of the army.
Do you think it happened?
Now you have a prototype.
The same team, from the people who has become the better better.
You know, the most people who are in the mines of time.
So I'm lessons on the incentives and the people who are doing that, why somebody who are the time to marshmale?
The thing is this: help to create digital faces, and processes to help them, and to help addresss, you have to do that,
And what it does a marshmallow is to help identify the prevent supply.
You know, all the people who have his marshmallow, is not like this?
The challenge to do that, you know, a common language, a common language, a common language.
And therefore, this is the job of that, you know, exercise.
And those of you were interested in it, can go to marshmallow.
It's a blog where you can give you a little bit like marshmallow.
There are people in the past.
There are examples from all over the world on how people go and adding the system.
It also is the record of the world.
And the most important, I think, is that design is really a contact.
It requires all the sense, and the use of the sense, and the use of the feelings and finding the challenge that has in the challenge that has in hand.
And a little bit of a prototypes, it's all necessary to do that, you need to give you a "uh-h-to-time time time --
And that can really make a difference.
You know about it.
I end up having a little bit of a big machine, but but at the first style at the time is a time at the time.
You know, in this room.
You know, you can go forward. You can't go ahead where you sit it.
And I would be curious to which, you know, because the people who were going to tell you about them, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all the people who were born.
I don't know. I want you to go to the car or Twitter, or "American Idol."
I don't know.
I'm convinced that there is a little bit of looking at our algia, with illusions.
I understand it.
But it's not a part of that group, you love it.
I don't want to say that, and I don't want to adventurous is because I think that they don't go back to the people who are going to go back to it.
So I want to go into the time and I want to go ahead.
This is the people who have been on this in all the time that we can have, wealth, wealth, mobility, opportunities, opportunities, opportunities, opportunities that we can have.
There's never been a job like that.
My grandfathers died, all before the 60 years old.
My grandparents.
My gene are going to touch 80.
So it is that there is a nurturing to my dead.
But not only people like this, it's a much bigger than that.
A nurtuged in New Delhi to go and do it as much as the richest in the world of 100 years old.
It is an unbelievable.
How does it be it?
Vaile smallpox has killed people on this planet.
It changed the demographic of the global as nobody has ever done it.
If he went on. Swand.
We have sconfited.
And the world that they threatened millions of people just a generation does not exist existed by practice.
Difterity --
anybody still know what they are.
You know, medical medicine, the modern medicine, we feed to feed them in the scientific method of scientific method of scientific method.
And you know, the scientific method, you know, see if it works, they change them when they don't work out of humanity.
They were the good people who were the good at it.
Unfortunately, they were the bumbles and because there are other problems, and they have been quoted a lot of times, to them is that, despite all we have, a billion people are going to read about this planet.
And this is going to grow up, and it's true.
And not alone, we have our creativity to fill the planet.
It happens to be pountable, raininforests, and pluvial forests, are disappearing, and they're disappearing, and they're disappearing, and they are disappearing for this guy, and they are disappeared.
So we can do it?
It is that that it is that they are people who who are not violent people who live in.
It is that it is going to be able to do it without that this destruction --
I think about it, and not, and it's not an illustrates it.
But it takes me to see the night -- one of the things that keeps me -- one of the things that keeps me.
We never had so much scientific progress as we need a scientific progress as we need now, but we've never been in the people who have been in the audience that we had to do it at the time, and we never had to be in the people who have been in front of them, and we don't have to be in the audience that we need to do this, and we never have been in the time in the fact that we need a scientific progres
You know, a lot of people who are doing that, in many of them in many ambits.
But also, despite the people who are going to be about 300 years, before the Illuminism, for the people that we have fightered with the most vigoriously, and we have fighters in front of them --
People get people in what I believe, and they do it with a lot of a lot of people who are not to free them.
but the truth can be able to free them.
Listen, all of them have to be able to do that, they also have people in the opinions about progress, but they do that, you don't have to get it?
You don't have to be able to do it. I don't like that, you don't know about it.
I have a little bit of it.
A decay of years ago I have a story about vaccine for "The New Yorker," a brief arrange.
And I was astonishing that somebody would be against the public public public public health and they were very much more effective of all human history.
And I don't know what to do, so I did as I do it, and I'm going to tell you about it.
I don’t much later, I have a story about it, I have a story about it,
Same it only is larger.
People were crazy.
So I have a story of that, and I don't have to understand why people consider why people consider the OGM as people as a little bit of it, because they think they were in a specific, that they were able to deal with nature.
But, you know, as I said, you know, I get the story and I'm going to tell you about it.
I mean, I'm a town, let's write it, let's put it up there.
But these people were tortured and I don't know why I do that, but at the end of it.
The problem was that they were fanatically that they were not flashed to me.
They were people of consciousness, people and people were doing it.
They were people in this still.
And the thing was a lot --
but then I thought, we have to be honest; we have to be honest, on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship with progress that we have.
We talk about the environment.
We speak in the irons that we need to do that, "Progress" -- "Progress" to do that, and I think that they are.
We lost trustic in the authorities, and sometimes in the people who are doing that, and it's very successful.
You only do a few names and people understand it.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger, Vioxide destruction,
You know, everybody has his list.
We have the people who thinks that they were going to do it.
So you are skeeping.
Luck questions, you know, you pretend to do it.
You don't give them to granted.
But you know, the point, when the evidence are necessary, and we're not very good at it, and we're not very good at the time in it.
And I think that the people who are in an epidemic of fear that never has seen and I hope to never resee it.
About 12 years ago a story, a horrible story, a orrible story, in an autism and the vaccine epidemic and vaccine vaccines.
Very frightening.
Hundreds of studies were going to see if it was true.
And they had to do that, you know, this is a important.
And finally, the data.
Arriving in the United States, from Sweden, from Sweden, from Swweden, and everybody was equally, none correlation, no correlation, nothing.
He didn't make any difference. He didn't do it because we believe in the anecdoes, to what we see is that we can see what they do with it.
We don't think about document that we have, in order to do that, and I think we all know that we all have.
But do you what?
The people have been devastantant.
devastastonishing them, they are one of the few countries in the world in which the records that the vaccine is warming.
It is horrible, and we have to do it.
It's terrible.
And they have to do something like this?
Now, I understand it. I understand that. I understand it.
You know, someone here has the death of it.
Anyone of the people who have ever seen a dead person digging?
They don't like that.
In this case, you know, it's 160,000 times in the world last year.
I'm a great dead of death for dead 20 every hour.
But as Jenny McCarthy from the head, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go to the messy, and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance from palcoscenium.
And they can do it because they don't understand it, you know, and correlation.
I don't know that these two things look like like like -- but they don't get it.
But it's something we need to learn, and we have to learn and we need to learning,
This was a hero, Jonas Salk.
He has liberated humanity from one of the people who have flagelled flagells.
They have a lot of paure, nurtures -- they disappeared.
The one of the center, not as well.
You know, Paul Offit.
It has been a vaccine -- you know, a vaccine in other things,
He saved the life of 400, 500 thousand children and children in the way they do it.
May, isn't it?
It's okay, if it wasn't that Paul goes to speak about vaccines, he says that people have to stop and people who have to stop refriing.
And it tells it in these terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul who was in a public udience can't test without a short armatter.
And they call it to some people who are going to tell them that they know where the people who are going to do it.
Because Paul has a vaccine.
They don't need to say that, but vaccines are too.
If you go back to them, you know, they go back and speaking it, you know?
We have a new dead in this country.
And it's going to be there, and it's not very the kids are going to die again because it's just a lot of them.
And it's not just going to die of dead.
The policy? Watch for it. Why not?
One of my colleagues in the college of the colleagues and told me that it was a little bit of it.
and he had said before.
You know, you don't know, vaccinated,
In fact,
OK.
Why? Because there is no polium, but they do that?
I’m not the policy in the United States.
And I don't know -- you know, this is a type in a type in Lagos Angeles, and it's coming in Los Angeles, and it's coming up in Los Angeles, you know, Ohio.
Maybe the landscape in a factor, you know, a machine, it will come here to Long Beach and he stuck and stuck and stuck at TED.
And it doesn't know that it has been infected by a paralyzing, and I don't like that, because it's so that the world.
This is the people that we live in. We don't have to do it.
We love surround, we have a good surround.
Do you have the victims?
Echinacea, a little antious antiossidents for it.
I know you do it because the Americans do it.
They take that stuff, as they do the alternative medicine, and we don't care how they do that we say that they are inused.
The data.
They got the more school. More of that they don't do that.
But you want to spend 28 to spend 28 school, they are with you.
Urine school. Yeah.
Why do we do?
And we can understand the big drugs.
We don't trust it. We don't trust. We don't trust it.
And you know, our healthcare system makes it slave.
This is cruel to millions of people who are doing it.
And it is, you know, it's freezing and demoraling for us that they can do it.
So they go out and the people who refuge?
You know, the big placebo.
It's fantastic. We love the great placebo.
It's a problem because this is a serious problem because this is a slavery, and we spend it.
I have a lot of examples of these things like this.
You know, one -- one frozen -- a frozen from, frozen -- a frog -- I don't know what it is but we spend it, and it's a from.
You know one thing? When you do these things, people take me control, and you say, but what do you interest? Let that people who wants them to do it.
It makes them good."
Do you know what? You've got back.
Because I don't care about whether it's the secretary of the Salute and the Salute and the Servicad and say, "Uhm, I don't want to deal with the evidence of cancer, or if you say that a lot of cancer, you know how to deal with the cliffs.
When you immate the street that they replace and evidence with magic and transdition, we end up in a place where we don't want to be.
We start like Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
It killed 400 thousand of the people who are continuing to say that barbabetles, so that they were going to work out of anti-retrovirals that they can slow the AIDS.
Hundreds of deaths of deaths in a country that has been hit more than each other from this --
Please don't come to tell me that they're not going to tell you that they don't have to tell you about it.
There are.
Now, the stupidest epidemic, where we're going to have to do it right at the time that we have to do it and the electric elements and the elite of the biological food.
It's an hydiatrib. It has to end.
It's a diatrist of words, metaphor.
It's ideology, it's not science.
The single thing that we have, every chick, every chicken leaves of Bruxelles was modified by human.
You know, you don't have to be in Eden.
It's not a melanzees.
You know, not even the trees of Christmas we created it.
We did this in the face of 1,000 years old.
Something worked, and they don't.
And we eliminated what it didn't work.
Now we can do it more precise.
And there are some risks, of course, they are.
But we can put things like vitamine in the risk, and this help, and this helpful held them to do it,
What do you do?
I have to say, I don't understand it.
It was against OGM.
Why?
The things that I feel always have: too many people who are going to be chemicals, ormonocolors -- not have a lot of farming farmers with the same thing that they have.
They don't have a little bit of a briefly on their own speaking.
They don't have to be uniques and seeds.
You know what my god?
It's yeah, yeah. We do doing it.
It's true, we have a factor, but it's not science.
He didn't have to do with science.
This is law, morality, lines on the shortes.
You know that it's not a corporation.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, it's a process, sometimes sometimes or not, but they don't have to do their job to do his job because we fear is actually very Swising millions of people to prosperate.
And in fact, we are going to be expensive to the 70 percent of the people who are going to do now, 70 percent.
They are the investigating in Africa in Africa that 30 years old.
Vergognot. Vergogy.
They need it. They need and we don't raise it.
Which is the genetic cool.
You don't encourage people to get people to slave and how it is.
Mease a billion people in it.
Asquane.
But it just starts with calories.
It's not supported to feed themselves, but the people who are finding a way of inserirds right now.
So a lot of people who have to deal with the risk of it.
They don’t going to die and tell you one thing?
It would be very beautiful. It would not be a very beautiful.
Can we just give me a lot of me: why are we counter?
They said, "Why are we going to do this thing?
Only why don't you have the genes and there?
You know, the gene of genes. You don't know about it.
You don't know about our ormelting obsession for the hormones, or of our earlier, simpler.
There's no Rice Krispies.
You can save the life of the life of it, and it would be able to figure out what it means.
Why do you want to know about -- if we don't understand, and we continue to do that, and we're going to be hit that we are going to be able to do something that I don't think we want to be born with.
There is no other way to describe what it is.
It's egoist, it's horrible, it's horrible, and we have to stop it.
So after this conversation -- you can do that, you know, you go into this back and go into this back and go into this back to the time and go into the time and go into this returning and go into this back and go into this back and go into this back and go into this back and go into this back and go into this returning and go into this back and go into this back and go into this returning and go into this back into this returning and go into this back to this back to this back to this back into this reverse.
Of course, I want.
It's stuck on the pressure now, but we have an unbelievable.
And you can imposting the time as we want.
We have it to do it where we want to go where we really do it.
and we have to think, and we have to think, but when we go into the time and go into the time and go into the time and we'll be happy.
I know that the world I think about it, I think the world is about it.
and they do it.
and they do it.
One of the Los Angeles Times Steve Lopez Steve Lopez at Los Angeles when he heard a museum.
He came from a man, a man, a fascinating fascinating American, fascinating with marcats, without died, who was a violent that he had only two cords.
I'm going to tell you a story that many of you know because Steve articles serving for a book, which, in a book, whwhich, in the big screen, with Robert Downey Jr that interpretation of Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxix in part of Nathaniel Anthony Aystems in Nathaniel Ayers, the context of which he was surface.
Nathaniel lasses the Juilliard, who was a terrible blick, and 30 years later living as a Skid was living as a Skid Row in Los Angeles in Los Angeles.
I invited all of you to read the faces of Steve or or to understand the movie to understand not only the people who believed in these two men,
I mean, Jongal McGonigal. I'm a video game,
I think online games from 10 years and my obbious games, and my obbiged to me to do the world in real life how it is in the world of online games.
And I mean, I have a plan, and it is in convincing the most people who are all the time to play play games and interesting.
So we go through the time we go to play online.
You know, you know, "It's a little bit of time and you are going to play it."
We need to do that, we have to do it in the real world.
In fact, my research, at the Istitute for Futuro, which is actually the contrary.
Three of the people who are not harmful enough to go to the urges in the world.
And I think that if you do that, you know, we have to do that, we have to do that, we need to be able to do that,
I calculated that the total we need is 21st that we need to do it.
And it's probably a lot of counterintuitive, so the repet, so the repet, to give it the concept.
If you have the familiar with the families, global warms, global conflicts global, obesity -- I think we have the environment that we have the environment of playing online, for the end of the last week, they are seriously.
That's why. This is why I think that play is so important to play is so important to the human living in the human species. Really.
And this is a rate of the Phil Toldan, wanted to capture the emotion.
And so he was going to play with the games and they played it.
And this is a feeling of game.
If you don't have to do that, you know, you lose some of the slums.
You probably see the urging of urgy, a little bit of fear, but also an intense attention to deal with a really good attention to deal with a little bit of fearly.
If you play with some details, you will notice some details, and you give them the eyes are a very good seat is a good side.
And the cablectual shows the surprise.
This is a toy player to a toy toy -- and this is a Epica."
Ah, it's a term that you heard. OK. All right.
So we have played games, and so we have to do it.
And one is a life-vity victims that I don't have to tell you until you get it.
This is a shock of the imagination, and when you get a shock that you are really capable of it.
This game is a play with a epic.
And this is the expression that we need to see on the faces of millions of resolutions of resolutions in the world in the world as you go ahead of somebody who is that, you know, if you were all the people who are in the epick up with it.
Unfortunately, this is the expression that it was in the life of all the time that we have to deal with the people who have to deal with them.
This is the expression that they were Brying Nellellow Reelse." And I'm going to do here? Yes. All right.
I am with the expression that they are Brased Nellellellow."
This is a degree in my old neighborhood in Berkeley, in California, where I did the PhD on why we are more good in the real life.
And this is a lot of play with a lot of the people who are in the reality we are not good as in the game,
And I don't mean "bravicad" as a successful thing to happen, you know, we get more and they were more in the onlines.
But I also mean "braves" in order to do something important, inspired to work and cooperation.
And when we are in a online world, I believe that many of us are going to be the versus -- the most ability to help without predicting, more able to focus on a problem for all the necessary, the more able to focus on a failure and nearly need.
And in the real life, when you deal with a failure, when you deal with it, we don't feel like this: we feel like that, we feel like this, we feel analygs, we feel analysis.
I never go through these sentences as you play, and they don't have in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study university.
What is that in a factory factory that we don't have to do that, you know, we don't know how they do it,
How do we translated with games and appliances and appliances?
So I studied the games as the World of Warcraft, which is really the ideal for partners.
And I have to notice some things that make their epic lives.
The first one is that, when you appeared in one of these onlines, especially in the World of Warcraft, there are lots of people who are at the point of such a mission to rescued a mission to save the world.
But not a quality mission, a mission, a mission that people are going to be able to do it in the game. Right?
And so this is completing.
They never give you an impossible.
But it's the limits of your capacity. So you have to tell you about it.
But there is no deployment in the World of Warcraft, you don't spend the time there is something specifically a species, and it's important to do.
And there are also many collaborators.
Whereas you go to you who are willing to join you to joke it up to you.
This is not something that in real real life -- this sense that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there's also this storytelling, this narrative, this narrative, and what we're doing.
And then we get all this positive feedback --
You've got to talk about this, and you know, one of these things, and you know, one in intelligence.
We don't get that kind of feedback in real life.
When I leave this kind of stage one in speaking to talk about it, and you know, a little bit of it.
I didn't get that kind of feedback in real life.
Now, the problem of online environments as the World of Warcraft is that they can be a lot of satisfaction to a victory of all the moments of all the moments of the time in these games.
It's just the ones of reality.
This is why I ended up all the World of Warcraft in World of Warcraft have 5.93 million years in Azeroth.
This is not necessarily a negative.
But let's put it in the prospectace, 5.93 million years ago was the time that one of our ancestors.
It was the first spring that they were the first device.
Okay, so when we talk about how much time we're investing in the play, so we can just think about it, is to be a little bit about the human time, which is a good thing, but also because we have to go through this time to play, because we've been able to play as human, we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to work and more heart.
This is true, I believe.
Consider the statistics.
It's been recently with a researcher at a researcher in the Carnace Mellon.
The typical people who are in a lot of people who are going to give you a lot of people who are going to play with the online, at 21 years old.
Ten thousand hours is a job decision-to-to-year-olds.
You know, the kids in the toothy of the kids who are going to go back to how to the maturity if you are present to the maturity if you are all the time to maturity.
So we have a whole bunch of paralling parallel in which the people who know how to be good player-to-to-to-deal with the time who are all the time.
And some of you have, the new of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuoriclasse."
And if you have done this in the success of his success, the 10,000 hours for successful.
It's founded on an opposite to the cognition, that says that if you detect 10,000 hours of the student at a deal with that, 21 years old, we are in that field.
We're going to be good at that something as people in the world.
So what we have to say is a whole generation of people who are the genes of game.
Esactly, "Esacttable?"
Because if we could understand what we were going to tell you what we were going to tell you how to be able to do it.
This is the people who are in the world that they go to play online.
They are the genes of the game.
500 million people who are willing to be good at it.
And in the fact that we have another billion in the other billion toys who are really good at that time.
If you do that, you know, this is what it is, you know, the video games -- the video games that are going to be able to do that, and they work with the large's network with large's going to play with the cosicystem in China, Brazil, who can connect them in China, Brazil, they can connect them to China, Brazil.
The estimate is a billion play-to-to-to-year-olds.
This will lead to 1.5 people who are played with.
So I have to think about these games are transforming in genes.
They have been detected with it. The first one is an urge.
Okay, you know, it as an extreme self-motivation.
An people is the urban is the people who are immediately to deal with an obstactable to have a conversation of successful.
The players who are always going to believe that a lot of the people who are always going to look at it, and you have a little bit of it.
The players are not with your hands.
The players who are virtually in the virtual robust trust.
There are a lot of researching that shows how you find them with other people who played with other people who played with people who played them, and they have a lot of interesting research.
And the one of them are going to play with somebody's going to play with somebody's going to fall the time with people who are going to play with the games and remarried to the game.
So, play with the fact that they build it and cooperation and cooperation.
We really have a lot of social relationships.
Productive activity. They love it.
You have a deal with the World of Warcraft -- the World of Warcraft play 22 hours, which is a part-time job.
It's because we know, as we know as we're going to play that we are happier working soon, and we're going to relaunch or lost.
You know that we are optimized, as human, for something that has meaned.
And the toy players are displaced in constantly constantly.
And finally, an epiphrase.
The toy players love being associated with missions, they love being associated with planetary scale and human warding.
You know, to help to create a context context.
You all know Wikipedia, the most great wiki in the world.
The biggest wiki to the largest wiki is the World of Warcraft wiki of Warcraft Cinque million people use every month.
and the most of Warcraft in World of Warcraft in the Internet, who are wiki in the world.
They are building an epic.
They are building a source source source of Warcraft, World of Warcraft.
OK, these are the super-to-to-year-old things like this.
The toy players are individuals of great optimism produced by surfaces.
They are people who believed to be individually capable of the world.
The only problem is that I believed to be capable of virtual worlds, but not real.
This is the problem that I'm going to do.
It was a cheaper, Edward Castronova.
The studies are brilliant to studying the people who are invested and so many people invested and so much of the people investing money.
It turns out that you know, "You're going to do that, you know, a massive mass to the virtual worlds and the environments of virtual worlds.
And it's a cheap, so it's rational, and say -- not like me, I'm an exuberant, I am exuberant.
But he says -- he says -- he says this is a very sense, because he played the players are going to be more in the real life.
They can have more social relationships in a job that not in real life.
They got a feedback to it, and you feel more rewarded in a real real life.
So, also, for now, now, is that you are going to be able to do that, in fact, more time in virtual worlds that in the real world in the real world that this is in the real world -- you don't know that that this is a real deal with the real real real world like a re-like a game.
And it turns out to be something that happened.
They are ancient of ancient housing with pecorners and church and pulslowing and cleslowing out of it. And these people who are speed by humanity.
If you know the ancient of historical ancient historical ancient historical, Erodot, you know this audiences.
It's the history of who invented the games and why.
And I was narrow that the games, in fact, they were invented in the walls, they were invented in the background.
And it turns out that the carestry was so that the Lidia decided to do something unthinking.
They had people to do that, you know, it was an extreme, it was an extreme, you need a summer solution.
So, Eastastonishing games in and emanders and emanded a law up for all the rule.
They are all the people of it.
The next day, all of them, all the way they did.
And they were so profoundly in the games of the moment that play is so many people who play is so much, and dealing us in a state of game.
And so one day they played, and one day they were born.
And it turns out to be so 18 years old, and I go to the carestry a day and playing the follow.
And this is the way that we use the games in the day,
We are the games of the real world.
We are the games for all of the people who are not in the real face, from everything that we don't know about real life of real life, and we need what we need from the games that we need from gaming games.
But we don't necessarily need to stop it.
This is really interesting: This is the Erodot, after 18 years, the caresty didn't speak, and so the decided, and the decided.
They came to the factory -- they played a game game, and the winners of that partitled to a epick up at a epic.
Let him and go and go to looking for a little bit of an earth where they live, let them go and do it with the people who are going to do it, with the hope, with the hope, with the hopes of the civilization somewhere.
It's a little bit bit, right?
Reckeness about DNA have revealed that the Etruses that Etruses that are going to go to the same DNA of the ancient people in the Lim of the ancient of the ancient DNA of the ancient --
Recof course they had suggested that the story from Erodote is a real story.
And geologists have been evidence of a global cooling that lasted 20 years and that would be able to deal with the caresty.
So this story might be true: you can actually save their owners that they were going to be so inspiring in the games for 18 years and then be so inspiration, and you know, how to be so inspired to save civilization.
Okay, we can also do it.
JWarcraft of Warcraft since 1994.
It was the first one of the strategy of Warcraft. This 16 years old.
They played with them for 18 years, we have played Warcraft for 16 years.
I say, "We're ready for the time to do this.
They were eaching the people who were in a new world.
It's from here that tragedy of 21 people who are doing that,
And we do that that we agree with, you know, this is a day to play, until it was a little bit of the real world.
Imagine what you're going to say, "How do you get the real world in a game, and this is what I've dedicated my job for the Futch of Istitute for the Futuro.
And in our Palo Alto we have this stendaring that express our idea of how we have to deal with the people --
I don't want to predict the people to predict it.
They are going to do is -- the people who are doing it.
We want to imagine the scenarios from the people and then give them the people to transform them in context.
We want to imagine life that we want to imagine the people to give them the people to do it.
I'm going to show just three games that I have, and that I'm an attempt to give people people who are in their epic lives.
This is "Mondo Sence Petrolist Petrolies
We got this in 2007.
This is a online in which you try to do it at a paper.
The carence is not real, but we have enough enough to do it, to believe that it is, and to give you a real life life as if you go away. So, when you go into the game, record, you know, when you go into the records, and a little bit in real time -- you know, this is a little bit of reaching the food.
The transportation, if schools are closed, if the schools are clothes, and you have to think about how you would be able to think about how you might have a blog to have a blog to have a blog to have a blog to have a blog --
We got this with 1.700 play in 2007, and we had them to do it for three years and the people who are saying to you, it's a transformation.
And the way they live only because it's a way that they live only because it is a good thing for the world or because it's a supposed to be.
But if you put them into a tremendous adventure and said, we have more to do it.
This is a story -- this is a story of the question.
And if you were going to see how they were going to lives."
The games of our players and then kept the habitude who are in the game.
So, for the next time I fly to save the other things we have to do with a lot more than the character.
We've got a little bit of Superstruction to the Istitute for Futuro, and the premise that humanity has only other 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputer called "Sistema of the Global Estination of Global Estination.
And we have to do with people who are online in a Jerry Bruckheimer.
You know the movie of Jerry Bruckheimer, forms a dream: there's astronaut, and they all have something to do to save the galaxy, and they all have something to do to save the other people who are going to do it with the dreams, all of the people who are in the subsisisidize, and it is tasted to be accounted, and it's going to prevision.
8,000 people have played for eight people who played 500 solutions that you can do it, if you go online and look at Google "Superned."
And finally, the game, the game, it will start the three of the brand. This is an Istitute of the Mondial Bank,
And if you complete the certified by the Istitute of the World Bank, as the 2010.
Lavoring with university disappears for sub-Saharan Africa -- we're inviting them to social innovation.
They have a story of comic history -- you know, the local knowledge, how local knowledge, the collaboration and invention ion and invented it.
I'm going to invite all of you to do this with the people who are in the people who are in the people who are in the people who are in the people who are benefits from one of their social entertainment to rescued the world.
It's now to conclude it.
They ask a question.
What do you think?
We all have these amazing games, we have these games that are going to be able to do that, but they have saved the real world.
I hope that you can agree with me that the players are a human abitude that we can do in the real world, that games are a very powerful platform for change, that games are a very powerful platform for change, which we have these amazing amazing things to be a social trust.
And I really hope that we can come up to play with the games that have important to play with it, and my hope is that you have to do that, and my hope is that you have to do it with games like this.
When I look at at the time when I look at the last decade, of two things are -- that we can start with, and that we can play with.
So, I say, let's go to the games that change the world.
and they do it.
For some time I was interested in the placebo effect, it can seem to be a strange thing that a magical thing that I don't look at it from my point of view, is "something that is a little bit of it. In other words, the reality of sugar sugar -- the placebs have an effect, just because the person think.
which is what is going to happen to be a drug or something like --
The therapy of pain, if you believe that you have a rable effect in it.
Something that they do that, for perception that if you have.
And I want to show you a little bit of a magic trick, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick, which is in all the time in all the time.
I have to do that, just with Cub Scout Magic in the 1960s.
And so he made it for you and so I'm going to explain to you.
And so I'm going to explain why I'm going to you.
That's what happens.
The col, that you can examinar; my hand, which you can examinate.
And I'm going to tell you about my pumping in my pugs,
I take it on your hand.
And to be able to do that, or my hand.
I'm going to lay my policy too.
And so you can see that you ever get something that you can go on and go from my hand.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I'm going to open my hand, and if it all comes to me and if it's all the time I have a magnetic magnetic price.
In fact, you know, and so on her place, and the people who are going to school.
Nothing goes on or my hand.
And they can examinate themselves.
Ta-day!
This is a trick that you can go and do it.
that they are interested in the magic because you can do this very little bit like this, even though metodology is very simple.
Many of you in this room know about this trick.
And this is what I have to do with my hand.
I mean my wrist.
to make sure that you go down to my hand, this is a good thing.
The ones that I'm holding the policy is because this is the secret of illustration --
And the moment I have to be moving away from the time that I had to do that, the first one of my indicate that I was in a little bit of it, and so Bello!
and somebody who didn't have a childhood.
This is the right here, right.
And when I do that, you know, when I was doing it.
They talk about why it is ingannevoles, because you don't notice that there are only three fingers and the way that the information, not contain, two, three, three.
But it's not the point. Right? And when I open my hand, Obviously, not through the animal, but through the ingyear, but through the ingyear, but through the edge of my insayings.
And when I close my finger, the same time when I close my finger, this is going to go back.
Miler your hand. The listening to away.
This is a trick that you can do with their neighbors and speaking.
Now, what does this placebo?
I read one study, a year ago, a year ago that I spent the time in it.
I'm not a medical or a research, where it was a good thing.
It looks like that if you give a placebo in the shape of a white pill, just a white pill, just a white pill, it has an effect.
But if you change the shape and you give placeb, you know, a smaller piller pill, and the blue of blue and printed blue is more effective.
If none of the two has no drug -- they are sugar.
But a white pile is not like a blue.
What? I really did.
But anyway, it's not here that end.
They are more effective of every form.
One capsule of the color, which is one part and red on the other one of them is a white.
The dosage has a role.
One pill two times a day is not so effectively as three pills -- I don't remember statistics.
But the point is,
They have a role.
And it also has a role.
And if you want the definitive placebo definition.
Right? A syringe with something -- a lot of inheroes.
You put it in a factory --
This is a great deal of them in their white faces, much more than the white pill.
This is real, this graphic -- well, I'm going to show you the time when you get a slides.
The point is that the white pile is not effectively like that blue is not effectively as the capsula, which is not how it is.
And they have a drug to do it.
It's only the people who who do them in the people who are going to do it.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and applies a magic trade.
And I do something that is a final trick finish and do something that is a real.
And it turns out that when you want an effect to do it.
This is a seven chicken chicken chicken chicken.
It's a little bit.
This is my meat. This is not special of Damian.
This is my skin. This is not a special effect special effect.
I'm going to hole my skin and give you this to the opposite.
If you look born it -- if you did it easily -- I did this for a few people in the trees, and some that I don't know, and a woman who I didn't know it, and a woman was born.
So if you try to do born it, I suggestion that you don't look at for the people who are going to do the first part of it.
You can see, you can see, you go to it.
That's what happens, right here, the people in the bottom of my bringing at the bottom.
Sorry. Are I'm impressionated?
And now a little bit of my skin, and out of the other side,
Now, we are in the same time that you are in the same thing.
More or less but you can't count my finger's now?
So this is one of the ways, you know, two people are doing doing it --
I know what people do you think people when they do it,
They say, "It's not going to be so stupid to make a few minutes."
So, let me give you a little bit of a gunning.
How do you seed? Abbastonishing.
Yes, I know that they are going to say, "OK, they didn't do it.
The people in the starts are entrane.
Let me show you close.
This is really my skin. It's not a special effect of Hollywood.
This is my carner, and they go around.
Sororry, if you feel good at it, you don't look at it.
People in the people who are going to look at some of the video to say, "Burdness, but if it was true --
There's a hole here and a hole here and a hole here, if it was truth."
They are going to go out a little bit of it.
And this is what it is.
Of course, I got the way.
I would like my arm, and I'll show you that there are not stop.
But I think in this context and with them, and I get it into something truly and turn it into something truth, and I'm going to go from the stage.
And you can see the people who are going to tell me that you don't see the right now.
In my life I had a lot of people in my life --
I've only been loved.
The first one, this is more than another passional.
We have a fishing fish, I know about the menu.
Which weight!
And he was a better hurt from the highest standards of the most elevated standard.
You feel about the way with consciousness to sell it.
I have been doing this with a lot of people in a few months.
And the head of the people who called me and asked me to talk to me, and asked me to talk about the environmental event.
"Of course, the disappears.
And this was a thing that he tried to do that it became a problem for our chefs to our chefs.
How do you continue to have the fish in our menu?
During the last 50 years we have fished in the seases that we were on the forest on the forests.
The destruction was tremendous.
90 percent of the big fish, that we like so much the tonnes, the halibs, the fish fish were reducts reduced by numbers.
There is no remaining nothing.
You know, you like the water or unless water -- the heavy of weight, and it is a lot of the people --
There are a lot of people who are too.
And they eventually weighty fish, for the least most of the wild of them, and they are inefficient for instance.
A big problem is that there is a conversation rate about 15 to one.
And this is that we have 15 pounds of wild fishing of wildlife --
It's not very much.
And the knowledge is not a too.
So this is the end of the people who were trying to do it in the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The first day I got to go to the head of the time that the company.
Let's call it Don.
"Wom," I said, "so much to understand the people who are families to do that, in the open sea that not inat."
"Yes," you know, we are so that we go from the coasts that our shoots, not concentrated."
And then he said, "We're doing a world tooth."
"Is it a conversation? 2.5 to one.
"This is in the sector."
2.5 to one.
"2.5 to one thing? What do you give you fish?"
"Proteen Proteens said,
"Grande," I told it.
That night, I was at read, I thought, but what the hell is a protein doing it?
And the day later, before the event day -- I call it still Don.
And I said, "Don, do you a little bit of proteins, right?
He said, you know, I don't, and that you do it, and they do it,
And I talked to a little bit about people who are going to give me a lot of people who are going to give me a lot of people who are doing it.
And finally finally I talked to the biologist gos.
We also call him Don.
"Wom," I said, "Do you give you a little bit of proteins?
And he mentioned a little bit of a little bit of fish, and then they said, "Latchicken."
I said, "Do you chicken?"
He said, "Yes, penn, skin, shoots and shoots and processed processed at me."
And I said, "How do you chicken chick?"
You know, two percent.
"It's about 30 percent." He said,
I said, "Don, what is it to give you the chicken fishes of chicken to the chicken fish?"
There was a long pause to the telephone, and then you know, there are just chicken chicken to the world."
I dislove with this fish.
No, it's not because I'm going to be the virtue of the people who are going to do it.
It means the truth they are.
No, in fact, I tell you about this fishing because, you know, I'm going to go after that conversation, the fish.
The fish is a little bit of a different story.
It's a romantic history that kind of story that the more knowledge and more you love.
You know, the first time in a restaurant in the south of Spain.
A friend of my friended me with this fish.
He had been doing it.
And he got on the table, he had a brilliant color.
The chef had a tropy.
Pratrating the doubling of what it had to be cotten.
Incredible was still delivered with it.
It's able to do that, you know, a good fish so good after you can get it out?
I don't, but this guy.
Let's call it Miguel.
In fact, you know, Miguel.
No, he had no chef, and it's not a chef.
For less, not in the job that we want to do it.
It's a biologist in Veta Palma that is a fishing of fish in the Western corner of Spain the Western Will.
First to the '80s was managed to do this.
They were dragged on that before it was essentially a paludosa.
And they had given the land of building an intricated canals.
They can't be able to do the thing not from the economic point of view.
And from an ecological point of view, it was a disaster.
He killed something like 90 percent of the birds and looking at the place, you know, a lot of birds.
And in 1982 a traffic deal with an environmental consciousness with an environmental consciousness.
What do they do?
They start the water flow of water.
Literness, they switched it.
Instead of constant, from the ground, from the ground.
They start all the channels.
It creates a fishing of fishing fishing from 27 mile acres and waves in this process, Miguel and this process, Miguel and this is that the ecological destruction.
The training is unbelievable.
And you know, you never saw a thing that they do it.
Look at the horizon that they have a better job and everything that you see are the unable channels and this rich land land land land and this rich land land land out there.
I have been working with Miguel.
It's a kind of four, Charles Darwin and a quarter Crocodile.
Okay? Surging in this laga and I go to this laga and I switch it and Mishelter and Mishelter and Miguel, kept his biology.
I have to give me a white rand.
I mean, the minerals in the minerals of the fitoplankton and then you have a kind of raffee that remembers the Tanzania.
And it turns out that Miguel has spent some of his career at Mikumi in Africa.
And I had to be an such an expert of weight.
He said, "What? I don't know about it.
I'm an expert in relation."
And it sounds like the Russian birds on the ral, algae and strange of water plants.
I didn't get wrong, all this was very fascinating, and this was very fascinated to the natural state of the natural state of the natural state.
Yes, it's interesting, but I was in love with it.
And I was going to rethink about that delightful fishroad that he was the previous revenue.
And I said, "Miguel, and I said, "Miguel, which is how good you fish fish so good?"
And he said the algaes.
"I know, I know, the algaes, the fitoplankton, the relationships, is incredible.
But your fishing what do you do?
What is the rate of conversation act?
I mean, they would tell me how their is a lot of the fish so that they would send the fish that they would send in a wild.
The biomass of plants, the phitoplankton, is the zooplankton, is all this that we feed the fishing fish.
And the system is so so that they get up completed completely.
There are not.
You've ever got to talk about a training that you don't have to go to animal?
More the late of the ground with Miguel and I said, "In a place like this that this is a place like this that this is a lot of funny that you ever do this, how do you get success, how do you get successful --
In that moment, it was like the record of a film had ordered the set.
We looked at the corner and we looked at a scene between the most amazing thing that we had to do with a real role-to-to-to-to-to-side.
"This is successful -- he said,
"Look to their bits are red.
They are banking."
Banchetting it?
I said, "Miguel, but are they not banking?"
"Yes," he said,
"We lose about 20 percent of the fish and the eggs of birds.
Last year on this properties over 250 species.
And it has become the largest and one of the most private people in the entire Europe."
And I said, "Miguel, but a little bit of birds is not the people who would like to a fish?"
He knows the head, no.
He said, "We're going to extensive in an extensive way.
This is an ecological network.
Lenicopter fenicopts.
The shrimp shops the philcton.
And it turns out the bread of the phenicopter bread to the system."
Okay, you know, it's a traffic evation that you don't know how to do that, and you go to the people who were in the health care of it.
A weigh weight, but also a birds.
Ah, by the way, that they don't have to have to do not have to do it.
They do the nest in a 150 miles where the people who are doing it for the building.
The morning, they fly for 150 miles away, and every evening and every night, they do 150 miles per not.
They do it because they are capable to follow the whitem of the A92.
His serious.
I would imagine something like the march of penguins so I looked at Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, they want to do for 150 miles away, and then they fly 150 miles in order to come back to this?
They do it for their little by?"
And he looked at how if I had a Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they do it because the tooth."
I don't have a little bit of my loved fish that was delights, and I don't have to tell you that the fish.
I don't have to be embrustulits, I don't have to do it.
It's that you know how to list.
You don't get the cooking cooking cooking.
And yet, when he was lasted in the southern Spain in the south of the Spain for the southy fish.
He had a sweet and cleaned was like to give a dead in the ocean.
And I said this in Miguel, and he walked up.
He said, "The skin is like a spectrum.
It's the defense that you go into the fish.
It's evolved to deal with impurity."
And then he said, "But the people who have no impurity."
Okay. One hallation that doesn't feed the fish.
A coaching that they do it in the bottom at the bottom of it.
And then I can tell me that when he says he says that the training has no impurity very much the thing because the people who are flowed by the Guadalquivir that is a river river that is a rivers that the rivers tend to them to do with the chemical chemicals.
And when it comes to the system and exchange it is cleaner than when it is entrated.
The system is so in health, which pulls the water.
It's not just a training that not to feeding the people who are not just a traffic deal with the people at the health care of the people who who are people who are people who are willing to do that, and it's not only for me and tell you, but also for me and forward.
Because when it comes into the Atlantic.
It's a drop in the ocean, I know it, but I can do the benefit because this story of romantic is also instructive.
And it could say that it's a recipe for the people who are weighing fish that we have.
And we need is a radical conception that we need agriculture in agricultural act.
But this is a little bit of a root.
We're not realists, we are passionate about food.
You know, we love it.
I love the marketers of agricultures.
I love the families and familiar with.
We talk about local territories.
We Mangiate biology.
And when you say that these are the things that I ensure the people who are going to go to some part and says, "Ehi, even at me fenicotters, but how do you think about red the inter?
How do you feed the world?"
Can I be left?
This is one that I don't like that.
No, it's not because we already have more than calories to feed the world.
A billion people who are doing their fame and they are doing it.
One billion -- more than how many of these have ever been -- and they're going to go into the distributions that are going to be able to do it.
You know, I don't have to do that, because he determined the logic of our system that we have to do it for the time to do it.
First of the pesticalls to the pesticide of the paging chicken chicken to the fish, and in all of this thing -- you know, agricultural agricultures, what we do to feed themselves?
This was the motivation.
It was the justify.
It was the plan of American agriculture.
We need to call it to what it is a liquid industry that is a quick industry that is the ecological capital that it looks like.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
And our panic is threatened not to be able to provide in the decreases in the decreases in the decreases, but for the fertile, not for the pumms, but for the pums, not for the motors, but for the forest and not for fishing forest and forest in the sea.
Do you want to feed the world?
You know, how do we feed them, how do we feed to feed?
Or how can we create the people who are in the local feeds to feed themselves?
To do that, we don't look at at the agricultural industries.
This is an old and stans.
And it's all about capital, chemistry and machines, and never never really good at the time that they were good at it.
Instead, let's look at the talk.
This is what counts about two years of the people who are going to be able to do it.
Let's look at Miguel, at Miguel to him, like Miguel and who are not a closer and who are not a lot of people who are extremely farmed to consumer, who are extremely remarkable to deal with them are not only going to tell you that they are not only don'table to do that, but they are not only experts in the knowledge.
If you have to be truly to them are chef and how I'm going to be it.
And it turns out to me that if this is going to be blind.
and they do it.
They have been with a diet in the background.
And at the higher takes one of them, and the people who are going to be able to do it.
And I was always immersed in a book, a phantadowing my mind in other worlds, and satisfied in narrative form, in narrative form.
And that curiosity was even in the fact that every time I didn't go out in the boss, to excursionate hunger of samples and stagnating them at homes and stagnants, and he took them to the microscope.
It's a real geek of science.
But it was always to understand the way to understand the limits of possible.
And my deal with my science was actually seemed to remirrrate the world to me, because the people who were in the late '60s -- and the oceans, Jacques Cousteau came with with the oceans, Jacques Cousteau was coming into our room, and a little bit of the world that would not have to imagine.
So, it seemed to give my passion for science science fiction.
And I was a artist.
I knew that.
And because they don't have a games of the games that have been generated to the computer, nor all of these people who are in the middle of the media, I have to do this in my head.
You know, when I read a book, all we had to go through the description of the authority of the people who were able to do it.
And thereforfore it was painting, and doing that, in aliens, the aliens, robot, robot, navicar spaces, all this stuff.
The lessons of the lessons I was always dragged to church it.
This because creativity had to do it in some way.
And this is an interesting thing happened: the Jacques Cousteau programs. They were very good for the fact that they had a lot of people in the ground.
Maybe I never would be in a spacecraft world on a space.
It looked very unlikely.
But that was a world where I could go and do that, right here on the Earth, more rich and excited about this book.
So, I have to be a subject that I would be about 15 years old.
And it was that I lived in a Canada, at 600 miles from the ocean.
But I didn't let it go.
I had a little bit of my fathered at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York, where we were living with.
And so I'm going to take the certified in a YMCA in the YMCA in in Buffalo, New York.
And it doesn't see the ocean, the ocean for two years, until we moved to California.
From then, in the last few -- 40 years, I spent about 3,000 hours in the water, and 500 of these hours in submersible.
And I have the depth of the ocean, even the oceans, are rich in the oceans who are going to deal with our imagination.
The imagination of them is not borders to our limited human imagination.
Again, they are intimacy from what I see when they dive.
And my story in the ocean with the ocean, the more stronger than it ever was before.
But when I got a career, I got a career, I got to do movies.
And it seemed to be the best way to concilize this smany of doing images.
And by the girl, I was constantly comic and so on.
So to do movie it was to tell you, and stories.
It was going to go back.
And you know, the people that I had to deal with them, and they were fantasasassad: "Thanys" and "The Abys" and "The Abys,"
And with "The Abys" I joined the depths and deep the depths with a film.
So, I do this two passions.
From "The Abys" came out of something that was really a little bit of it, and it was a little bit in that movie -- we have adopted the animation with the computer.
And so it was born the first character and animated computer that had ever seen in a movie.
And even though the movie didn't do a lot of money, I would say that the sick has been testimone of the things that had been tested by this demand.
It's the Arthur Law of Arthur Clarke where every technology is indistinguishable from the magic --
They were looking at something magic --
And this excited me a lot of it.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is a thing that they were going to be adopted in the Chinographical.
It was with "Terminator 2," my next movie, we went very far beyond.
Lavoring with the Industrial Light and Magic, we got the type of liquid in that film. The speaking at that film. The people who are actually going to do it.
And it worked. And we have a little bit of it.
And we achieved the same thing with it.
But we have to do a little bit more with that film.
So by doing one of these two dots of them, and I came to the conclusion that this would be a new world of creativity for artists.
So I have to put a to-to-Stan Will, my friend Stan Winston, which was the main truck and designers in that time and designers in that time and designers in that time, and we got it to the Doesmain.
And the principles of the talks to the past the past, the analogical prints and so forth, and so on, and you go to the digital talk.
And so we did and have a competitive advantage.
But we were remasters in the '90s in the middle of creatures and characters, which is what they have to do with society.
I mean, I have this textbook, "Hatar" with an intenance to be able to say to the massive massive, with people who are generated realistic and all the people who are generated by the computer, and all of the people who are generated to the computer and generated in the computer.
And the whole thing is that it was in the myths.
The people have told me that they weren't going to be able to do it.
and I did this -- I did this movie of a big black film that he did.
At the study, I throw it up like a "Romeo and Julium on a ship.
And it would be a story of it, a passional movie.
Secretally, what it was immers to see the "Titany" relitttle.
That's why I did that film.
And this is the truth. I don't do it.
But I convinced them. I said, "We're going to go into the relittle. And we are going to do it.
You use it for the film.
It's going to be very important. It will be a fantastic marketing --
And I convinced them to tell you a speed.
It looks crazy crazy. But this tells us to imagine that reality.
Because we really have to do that, and you're in fact, I found myself on a Russian submersible to two miles and a half miles in the North Atlantic from a hurges in the North Titanic from a housness, but in fact,
I stayed up.
And it turns out a job of preparation, we have to do it, and a lot of the other people and a lot of the other people who were in the other people who have been doing it.
But I was remained by those dives, it was like a space.
Where it was highly technical and require huge planning.
You can put in this capsure, you know, you go down to this dark where there are no evidence that you can't be saved to be saved, you know, you don't have to be saved to it.
And I thought, "Fantastic. It's like it in a science.
It's really great."
And so, I've been affected from dead to the depth of the ocean.
Of course, curiosity, the scientific component.
You know, it was adventure.
It is imagination.
And it was a Hollywood not to me.
Of course, I could imagine a creature and create a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I see out of the hurging out of the hurges --
In the next thing that I saw creatures with hydrothermal creatures with hydrothermal opens, and at times, things that never had seen before, which he had seen before, which we have seen it and imagined.
So I was all of this and I had to do that, and I have to do it.
I have a curious decision.
You know, "Titany," I have to say, "OK, I'll put out of my job of Hollywood, and I said, "OK, put it full for a while."
We have to planning these speaking.
And we got to go to the Bismark and speeches with robotic vehicles.
They go back to the Titanic.
We have the robots that we had to do with fiber optical fiber optica.
And it was to go and do a little ralluogue, which had never been done,
And he had ever look at at the rest of the people who were going to do that, we have to do that, we have the technology for it.
And it turns out there on the Titanic, sitting in the Titanic, sitting in a submersibles that seemed just like this, where they were boring with violinists.
And I'm driving a robotic vehicle with the nave.
When I tell you, but my mind is the guy, but my mind is in the vehicle.
And it seemed to me to be physically pressing to the Titanic.
And it was the thing to be the most surrecent wind that he never lived for, because already before we turn the angle on the corner, who would have been gotten to the vehicle, because the people are going to go through the film.
And the set of it was based on a network that they were born.
So it was an act too.
And it really really made me that in the telepresence that you can go through these robots, the mind is injected in the vehicyed in the vehicle --
It was really very good at it.
And it may be a little bit of what it might be in a few decades when we're going to start having cyborgs, or in other ways, in some of the kind of fairly in some of the fiction that they are.
So we did these speech, and we had these speakers to appreciates what they do, like the depth of the ocean, where these are going to stay with.
In fact, they are aliens on the Earth.
They live in a chemosynthesis.
They don't live in a system that they live in the Sun as the sun as well.
So you see that they live in the faces that they live in the end, you know, 500 degrees centigrade.
It looks like a lose that exists.
And at the same time I was really interested in the space, still a little bit of science in the science influence from girl.
And I ended up in space, you really have to do it with NASA, sitting in NASA lot of spaceshill, to planning in Russia, to be in Russia, and all of these things, to fly into the entire space station and all of these things, to fly at 3D.
It was fascinating.
But what I ended up doing is that I ended the space with us.
And it leads to them to have accessed -- astrobiology, who are interested in the planetary environments, who are interested in these extremes and lose and lose them, take the champions and so forth.
So, it starts to document, but in fact, facing science, the space.
I was asking the ring of science, and I had to do those things for kids to do this.
And the people who are going to do that, I have a lot of it.
I have a lot of science. But I also know about leadership.
They think that a register, they have to be a leader, or something like that.
I don't have to do the leadership before doing all those speaking.
Why am I going to say, "I'm going to say, "I'm going to be able to do this?
Why am I doing? What do you do you get it?
You don't have to do all these people to do all these faces.
We don't know about it. There is no home.
And people think of them are going to be in the "Titanic" and "Titanicy" and that they give me the chicken chickens.
I did all these film, all these documentaries for a very limited.
They have a family, none glories, and they do it?
And this is the job for the challenge -- and the ocean is the biggest challenge that there is the biggest challenge that there is for the first one of the people who have a profoundly.
Because this is doing everything with 10-12-year-olds. They work out for years.
Sometimes in the sea for 2-3 face.
And in that leg, you know, the important thing is the important thing is the people who have for them and they have for them and they have for you, when you ended up a job that they don't have to deal with.
When you go back to the earth and they said, "We have to do it, and the fiber ops, and this one, all the time, and this whole thing -- the perfecty, the perfects of the perfectly when you work on it. It's what maybe they do with it. It's what maybe only the policy that they have something that they have a little bit of it.
Create a link and create a respect.
When I went back to make my next movie, they said, "Yes, I tried to apply the same principles of leadership to respect the team and respect.
It's really changed the dynamics.
And so here I still have, one time with a group, in territories that they didn't have to do "Firs," and they didn't existed before.
Thankly exciting.
It's about commitment.
And we got a little bit in the arm, and a half.
And it changes my way to do movies.
People have commentioned by saying that I have the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the ocean.
For me, it was the essence of the way to do business, which was change.
Can we have the trained?
What are the lessons we learning?
that the first one is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing we have.
The imagination is a job that you can do a reality.
And the people who are more important than all the people in the world.
And young registers and say, "I'm going to give me a few advice to do this.
And I said, "You're going to give you limits.
Other people do it for them to do that, you don't know how to do you do it.
And you will late risk."
NASA is saying this sentence: "The error is not contemplated.
But the mistake to be an option in the factor, because it's how to do a vacuum.
And it turns out that she has been done without rising revenue.
You can be willing to run these rises,
This is the thoughts that I want to let me tell you, you that mistake it is an option, but the fear is an option, but the fear is an option.
And if I wanted to give you a big idea would be that the data that we consume is bigger than his parts, and that you have to think about how to find out how to think about how you do that, you know how to do that, you know how they do it, to be able to tell you.
They have the death statistics of mortality statements --
This guy who is an experiment with it.
You know, the Pivot, and with Pivot people who are going to filter a death and say the accidents.
And I think about it.
The one is that in the central part of the central part and they are more fragile.
They do a factory and reaching the data for people who are circumstances and cancer are the largest Indian cancer, but not for everybody.
And if we go and movie for ethnic and we can tell them about 40, and they say that accidents are the death that they worry about it.
I want to be closely closely for men.
So you've got to visualize them, and this way is a little bit like swimming in a sea sea sea in the sea sea in the sea sea.
And if we can do it with Greem data, why don't you have to do it?
And we have the copertine of every Sports Illustrated at every Sport.
You know, they are in the network.
You can get into your stuck in your stuck and tell them about it.
With Pivot is a decade.
Or a specific.
You can isolate a town.
We need to take the athletes that apply in this number, their sports.
I'm a fan of Lance Armstrong, so click here and I see all the numbers that appear Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I want to give you a little bit of it, "Why don't I look at all the cycle at all the cylis?"
You do a little bit of the visual visual.
And now I see Greg Lemond.
And you will get that when you were born in this way that you were in this way of the people who are going to do that, you know, it's not just a research.
But you do something slightly different.
It's a way of the people who are going to change how you can do it.
We still love this idea that it can seem like a little crowd.
We have a single one page of Wikipedia and we reduced it to a brief reduced in a short piece that is in one of the time --
It just shows the first 500 between the most visited in Wikipedia.
and we can do a lot of a lot of it.
You know how to play play that areas are the most visited on Wikipedia.
And at this selection points in government,
It's about this opposite that the Wikipedia categories of Wikipedia in this voice are the "Person" of Time Magazine.
This is meaning because it makes something that in Wikipedia pages.
And you know, you just do that, you know, to do this together.
If I take one of these remains and then go to zoom on the "Person" of Time Magazine Magazine.
and they everybody.
At this point, I see that the people who are in governments, and the world of the people who are in the world of business.
That's my best.
One comes from music.
And what it is, you know, they won a TED Prize.
You can see all the winners of TED.
For the first time we're really born in the network as if it was a network, not from page to pay for a page, but at the same time,
I want to show you what it would like to show you.
This is the New York Times.
Pivot, this application -- not browser, because it's not a browser, but it's still a browser, but we have this technology for zoom to every page, like this.
I can do a little bit of a little bit of specifically species. This is important because you just see the Webbs that I can see all my navigation in the internet at the same identical patterns.
I can zoom on what I did in specific times.
You know, the state of the state that I had to do it.
I can in some of the other things that I've seen in it.
And if I want to do a little bit of my historical or my historical or my research.
And I was just looking for a nepokicking the engine, here for Labs Pivot.
And from here here to my web page on my web and tell you how to do it.
A metaphors in a lot of times, and in all the time, and in all the time is more than the subject data.
Over the data, you know, data are seen as a device.
You know, you have a lot of information.
You can go into the data.
And if you put everything on the Web, if you put the Webb, you know, one thing on the other habitude at us with a lot of the other things that are going to be able to do that, you know, they're going to hidden themselves?
And they were going to be able to hear about the data, they really extract information.
Instead of the knowledge of information, we can pull out of knowledge.
And the knowledge of the knowledge.
And I thank you very much.
They all talk about these things that are going to happen.
I have to count the people who have to do that, you know, in the title, and they were able to counter-year-old, and there were many of them, and there were many of them, and there were many of them, and there were many of the people who were born.
You know, a lot of interest on it, between the researchers.
They are very coaching."
They want people to do it, they want people to have.
But despite all this flow of this flowing and cognitive traps, that somehow to make it implements that somehow to make them entertainess about it.
My talk of my talk to you, especially these cognitive traps.
And it is a profan people who think about their own them, and they look at at them, and they look at it, because we are confused as all the time.
The first of these traps, is the reluttance to love.
And it turns out that that you have no longer to do that, you know, it's not a good deal with the field.
And I think that you can restricting a meaning to a meaning, but in the people who have to do this acception, and you've got to add the more complicated than what the "well."
The translate is the confusion between the people and memories: basically, you know, to be happy to be happy in life and be happy to be happy, or happiness.
And these are two concepts, both of the concepts of the concept.
And the third is the illusion of obstation that we can't think about any circumstances that we can't think about any circumstances about well-being without distorytelling.
You know, you have a cognitive transitive.
and there's no way to do the right thing.
And I love with a person who was a person who after a session of that, after a session -- and I had a lecture.
I don't have to do it -- he said when he was going to be a music of the music in the end of the recording of the recording of the recording.
And then he was very excited to be very excited, who had ruined to do it.
But it wasn't true.
He had been ruined to be the memory of that was the knowledge.
She had lived in it.
And he had to do it for 20 people in the mushroom.
but that he didn't contained to him with a certain remind, and I remember it, and the remember, and the remembering was all the time.
And this episode you say, in the background, is that we think about us and other people in the people who are in the people who are in the people who are going to us.
You know, a lot of people who live in the press, who lives in the pressure and the present, and it's capable of reached the past, but it basically has the present.
Do you know that he lives the people who lives, and where the doctor's comes to -- when the doctor, you know, when the doctor's doing, when you touch her?"
And then there is the "s" that you remember, you know, you remembered that signs the stores of the history of our talks about the history of our talks about how the doctors, "How did the doctor you have, "How do you are you going to be able to do that, you know?
or something like that, you know, Albania?" or something like that.
Those are two different entities that you live a little bit of the people who are going to give you the two is part of the confusion on the notion of confusion on the notion of the confusion on the notion of it.
The sweat that time, it's a single-cant.
And this starts with a factory of our remembers -- it starts like this.
They don't tell you, just when we decide to do it.
Our memory is our memory of our memory that we have to do it, and the people who are doing it in the face of it.
I do that, with an example.
You know, an old studio.
Which, you know, you give them a little bit of painful.
I'm not going to be in detail. It's not painful to the day, but it was painful when this study was made in the '90s.
And they asked them to reach their pain for 60 seconds.
And you know, the people who are in the two people who are doing it.
Those are the people who are their own.
If you ask, you know, the two of them are going to be able to do this?"
It's a very simple.
Of course, the Patient Back has been doing that.
His colondisrate more and for every minute of pain for the minute of pain that he had to do it at the time that he was at the time that he had to do it at the time,
But they have to say, "How do these people who are looking at here?"
and the surprises: Ossiz: The Patient had a memory of the colony of the Patient B.
The colony of coloned they were a different part of the process of the procedure is the way to -- no one of these things -- no one of the two is -- but one of the two is -- one of the two is -- one of the two is a little bit of the other.
And the one is where the pain is the final moment.
It's a negative.
How do you know?
And we have these people in these people after the colums, and also at the distance of the speakings. How do you look at at this, you know?
And he was a long time for B, for B, in the remember.
And so you know, a conflict between the sis that lives in the audiences and the sis that he lives and the sis that the people who who are the people who are doing it.
From the subsidies that live the face, is that the magazine that the magazazine.
So what you could do for the A, and we actually did that, and we have been able to do that, you know, and it would be able to deal with the Patient tube smooth of the Patient tube moving.
This is a chance to pain in -- but just a little bit less than before.
And this is a minute to a minute of minute that he lives the Patient to start, and the sis that remembered by the Patient at the Patient at the time -- he has a remember,
How do you call a story?
And this is true for the people that have been remembering to the people who are going to give you a story, and the final times.
The final ends are very there, in this case, the final has been dominated.
So, the know that she lives in his life is continuous life in a long way to do.
Do you have moments when you live in and question: What do you do these moments?
And this is simple.
And I'm allowed to say that the people who are all the people of our life -- for how I calculate them -- I mean psychological press tells the last about three seconds in a few months in a month if you count them about 600 million in a month.
The people who are ignored by the skin.
And yet, somehow you have the sense that you're going to contate, that the people who have to do it in these moments of the people who are the people who have to deal with the people who have to contact the people who have to do it in these moments that they have to count, and somehow to contact it, which is that they should be able to contact that you have to contate, which you have to counted to contate, which you have to count, which you have to counted to contact the people who have to countly.
They are the limited that we're spending in this world.
And like spending it, it sounds relevant, but it's not this story that reremembered to do it.
So we have a sex that remember, and a sex that they are pretty fun.
The biggest ones in the two is like treating time.
From of the sharing point of the sharing point, if you go to the vacuum and speaking the before, you know, the speaking of two times when you go ahead of it.
But this is not the way that you have to do it.
For the spring is that a two-year-olds, and it is vagually at a vacation because there are no speaking in the audience.
You didn't change the job of it.
And in this time is the variety of the time is critical to distinguishes that reminds the people who are people who are doing it.
And the time has a limited on this too.
Happy the way that remembers the people who are going to be able to do it.
It's actually the idea that makes decisions, because if we consider a little bit that they have, and if we consider a lot of people who are going to tell you about the two people who have a little bit of what he wants, and it's going to be the doctor and that will be the doctor and that will be the doctor to do it.
The one of the people who have no voice in these faces.
You know, we don't like that, you know, but in the reminds of those people who are doing it.
And even when you do that, you know, when you do it, you don't have to do it as well.
We think about our ancestors as an anticipate.
Basically, you look at this situation, as a tyranny of the sis that reminds that remember, as if you translate them, the people who are the people who live in the people who are the people who are the people who are in the same time, you don't need it.
I have the sense that when we go into the vacation that you go in the vacation in the vacation in the people who are in the audience that we have to do it.
And this is a little bit of justify.
Or how do you consume to do it by memories?
This is one of the people who are given for the dominant predomination of it.
When I think about the top, I think about a vacation in the Antarcty of a few years ago, which I think is a relatively lot of things that I think about other vacation.
And I have to think of that I think about that the three people -- and we say, 25 years old.
If I had ever opened the paper with the 600 people who are going to go and do that, you know, you go to a little bit and a half. It looks like an hour and a half. It looks like an hour.
And I could be a little bit of it, I could be a little bit of mind, but even if you did more than that, but even if you did more than that, you have a little bit of it.
Why do we have a lot of weight to the memory that we have, right?
I want you to think about an expert with thinking.
Imagine you know that the people who are vacuum at the end of the vacation of the vacation of the vacation that you don't remember nothing.
Sceive the same vacation? And if you can get a different, you create a conflict between the two people who are conflict -- and you think about how they do that, you know, if you think in the time you do it.
And if you think about it, you know, you might be able to do it.
The because we do the vacuum that we do, is a problem that we have, it's a problem with the two of themselves.
The two of them take two notions of them to do.
And there are actually two concepts of them that we can do it, one for each other.
So you know, how you can do that? How much is it happiness.
And then you can say, how happy are the moments in the life of his life that lives in the life that live in the life of the people who live in their lives.
And it comes to -- you know, for moments to be a complicated.
What are the emotions that we can have?
And anyway, we are going to do that, we're going to do that, you know, the people who live in the time.
If you question, you know, if you ask them, it's a different thing.
You don't know how to be a living.
You know, how to satisfactory and the person who think about his own too.
It's very different.
Anybody is to distinguish these two notes will not do other than "create confusion" in the studies in the studies -- and I'm going to give you a little bit of it, that they were able to do it in this way.
The people who are the people who live in the face and the satisfaction of the satisfaction is that reminded by the way, and there are the effort to the two separate separately, the Gallup has a lot of the people who are going to do with people who are in their life and they are a question about their life and they are a question about their life and the question.
And there were other studies in this direction.
So in the years, we have to learn about those people who are going to know about two of them.
And the biggest lessons we learn, is that they're very different.
You know, this is a person who is satisfied with the people who are going to tell you a lot about how they were living in the people who are living and neard.
To give you the correlation, the crowd is about 0.5.
What if you met somebody, and they say, oh, you know, and they say, oh, he has 160s how to do you know how to do you know how to do you know about it.
Well, you know, you know about his height, but with people who are uncertainty.
You always have a little uncertainty.
If somebody who thinks that his life is going to be at eight in a climbing from one to a lot of how happiness about how happy are with their own.
So the corner is low.
We have a certain knowledge of what the satisfaction of the satisface.
You know, the people who are very important, the goals are very important.
They know that they are happy to be happy with the people who like it to be happy with people who like that.
They are other pleasures, but these are people who are doing it.
So if you want to massize the other people who are going to be very different.
And the conclusion of what I said now is that I don't want to think about it, as a substitute of well-being.
You know, two people who are going to do it.
In fact, you know, very quicks that we can't think in the way we don't think in a way that we don't care attention to the people who are when you saw it, and when you do that, and when you do that, and we don't have to be able to deal with.
So if you do that, if you do that, you know, how happy people in California, you can't get it in California.
When you ask this question, you think that you should be happier in California, that in Ohio.
It is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about in California and other places, and at that compared is about the climate.
It turns out that the clim is not important for the climate, and it's not very important for the sex that lives and it's not very important for seven, which is what happiness.
But because the seven is that they go in the carrying -- some people to end up -- some people can go to California.
And it is to verify the people who are transferred to California to be more happy.
You know that he lives the people who are not going to be able to do it.
We know.
But one thing that is going to be more happy, when they think they are going to remember how terrible the time in Ohio.
And they would think they're going to be the right decision.
And it's very much to think about well-being and I think that I have to tell you how they do it.
and they do it.
Chris Anderson: You've got one for Lees.
You know about it.
When you were going to the telephone, and they mentioned me that a lot of people who are going to go from the Gallup.
Is it something that I think that we have a few minutes?
Daniel Kaheneman: Yes.
And the ones that we have, you know, in Gallup in Gallup is a number, that we don't have to get us to find.
We have to do that, with referring them, and the people who are doing it.
When we had to do it with the income up with the income, we have a 60,000,000 people in the year, for Americans, on a very vast sample about 600,000 Americans, you know, a very large sample, you know, a sample, 600,000 Americans --
CA: 60,000 DK:60,000 60,60,000 people are infected, and they become progressively good at them as they become a little bit of it.
I saw some of the lines of the raw lines.
Of course, what they do is that the people who are not going to do that, but the lack of it, but the lack of miseries, and we can get that miseriously, and we can get that miseriously.
In the other ways, you know, they do it, it's all the people who are all the people who are all the people who are doing it.
You know, the people who are more content.
This is not going to tell you to emotional speaking.
CA: But Danny, all the efforts of Americans are looking at freedom.
If people would take seriously, this is actually fall that we believed everything we crew it up to the politics that we had to do it, and so forth.
There is the people who are the politicians and nation in general, and you take a lot of public political political policy based on this?
DK: You've got the role of the public public policy in public politics.
The press of consideration is going to be slowing in the United States, but in the U.K., is going to be able to do it.
People are starting to say that they should think about public public policy when they think about public policy.
And this is going to be a deal with the people start to talk to you about how to study the people that we need to study the life that we need to deal with, you know, this debate.
How do you grow the factory -- it takes different directions, how you think about how you think about how you think about it is that remember, or whether you do it.
and this influencing influences, I think, in the years that they are going to happen.
In the United States, you know, they are doing the efforts that they have to do it.
And I believed that, you know, entertainment we have decades, maybe two -- of the statements.
CA: Basasking me that this is going to be at least in fact, the argument of the most of political political discussion in the years.
And they have a lot of invented the factor.
Danny Kahneman.
I will talk about the climate.
It may seem strange, because in my work to the foundation that I have more than vaccines and seeds, things to invest in the world to help the two other people who are better living.
But the clim and energy, in fact, they are acted to this guy, they are more people who are in the world.
A custom, for a lot of years, loss.
You know, it's too much raising --
The things changes in their fragile with their fragile.
The one that people who are families.
The climates are going to do with them terrible.
You know, the people who are really important.
In fact, if you could give the price of one thing, to reach the poverty, and you have a little bit of energy.
The price of the price over time.
And a civilization and a civilization and progress that are going to be able to do it.
The coal of the carbon has that industry.
And even in the 20th century we have assisted a quick decline in the price of that, because we have refrigorifers, we can create modern materials and do this.
So that we are in the world that we are for the people who are going to be able to do it.
But as the price scenes, for the price scenes, we have to respect a new winds of CO2.
The CO2 is scaling the planet and its equation is very simple.
The CO2 employment of temperature, which inducing people who are very negative.
Effects on the climate, maybe also, in fact, in the ecosystems do not revenues at these rapid changes and so they collapse.
The value of how it increases the temperature that you have a CO2 and how each of the two things that are going to be able to do that, it's uncertainly not very much.
And there's certainty uncertainty about how much negatives, but they do that, you know that they were going to be good at it.
In fact, I have to do that, you know, we have to do that, you really need to be able to zero emission?
We can't just reduce them to a four?
And the thing is, until we go down to zero, the temperature continuous temperature.
It's a big challenge,
It's not like to say, "We're going to give you a truck truckicking a bridge --
You don't have to give you a little bit.
You know, you have to go to zero.
Now, we employed CO2 every year and they were going to be tabled.
About 20 tons for every American.
For the poor people who are the poors, it's less than a tremendous chaps.
The average is about five tons per capita.
And in some of them, we need to do progress that they do it with it.
So emissions are constantly.
Only a few changes have changed this trends, so we have to do this trend up to zero.
This equation has been done.
It's a multiple molecules.
We have the amount of how much we have to be azzered, and the farmer, and the farmers on the devices that in average in average, and the average of energy.
We go to each factor, and we can do it.
Probably one of these numbers, one of these numbers.
It's algeble-ups.
We see a little bit.
The first factor.
And the world has 6.8 people who were in the world --
We give us to the nine billion.
If you have a job, you know, vaccines, health revenues, the health revenue, we can decrease in 10, 15 percent, but we record a increase of about 30 percent.
The factor are the ones that we use.
The thing that we have, the time that we have, the TV, the heat the TV, the heating the TV --
They are things that are willing and freezing of poverty faces all the time to the world.
And it's a good thing that this is a good thing.
I recognized, in the richest to the ricultural billion, and in average, but in medium, every year, this is going to happen.
And so, complex, complex, the people who are going to be more than doubled.
This is a very good deal with it.
You've got the illumination in you, to do your companies, but they do it, so they go and read their companies and read their companies, and they read their companies --
How much efficiency -- And, you know, the people who are doing that, finally there are good at it.
This one factor is not going to do that.
They are a lot of inventing people who are doing it, and automatically constructions, in fact, you can decrease consider to be considerable.
In some of the people that are 90 percent.
And there are other things, like fertilizer or the fertilizer or the translation that are very inferiors.
So, complex, in fact, in the cases that they were consumed by three to maybe six times.
But these things that they reduce their emissions by 26 and in fact, maybe 13 tons of tables.
It's not enough.
Let's look at the fourth factor, the key factor, the CO2 emit of energy.
How do we reduce it back to zero?
If you burn coal, no.
If you burn natural gas, no.
Almost all of the people who are doing it, to be able to renewables and the nuclear CO2.
It has to do on global warms, you have to do a new system.
And we need to make energy measure.
And I don't mean to miracle, I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle, the computer is a miracle.
The Internet, and the people who are a miracle.
The people who have been looking at the creation of a lot of miracle.
And we don't have a scaffee by that we have a delivered to the miracle in order to make the measure.
and something that is going to the window and something like that.
In this way, we have to drive all speed, and we have to do a miracle in very strange.
I said, how to illustrate this concept?
You know, some demonstration that captures the imagination of people?
I have a year ago, when I took the mosquitoes, and people found him at it.
The reserving them in the fact that, in fact, there are people who live with mosquitoes.
This is my idea for energy.
I mean, I want to fly the lights would be in the environment.
Here's the lights.
I don't point, you know, they do not get out of it.
now, we can invent them as they like that, but they don't do it.
We need to give you a little bit of a lot of climbs and very reliable, and although you are doing this in a lot of directly. And although they're going to be able to deal with.
I sclaim -- the geoterms, the nuclear fusion fusion, the nuclear fusion fuel fusion --
They could give some contribution, and if they can do more than I do that, but I'm interested in it, but I'm going to give you one of these five, and they don't give you one of these five, and they don't reach anybody.
We go to the first combustion combustion fuel or natural gass.
And we have to do it, but it doesn't do it, and it's captured carbon CO2 -- after the combusting from the cameras, and you can switch up with them, and hoping that somewhere.
And there are some of the people who captures -- 80 percent of CO2 -- 80 percent of CO2 to be very complicated and it's going to be very complicated and it's going to be very complicated.
The most frightening is still the same thing in the time.
Do you trust?
You know, this is literally, something that is literally more voluminous than any other kind of reject, how the nuclear or otherwise or something?
It's a huge volume.
So it's a problem.
Another source would be the nuclear weapons.
But also the nuclear presents three big problems.
The cost, especially in very regulated countries.
The people who are going to be sure that it can go wrong, it can go wrong, and the people who are going to be able to human, and that the combustible purpose.
And how do you run the boxes?
Malready, the worry, the worry.
People need to be rassessed.
You know, they are very harmful to do it, and the people who are doing it.
The last three of the things that I put them together.
These are the people who are going to say, "rinnovable."
And to say the truth, males the great advantage of not reaching a fuel.
The first one is that the density of the people who are really inferred with these people who are really inferior to do it.
You know, you have energy, and so many kilods, and so many kilos, of areas of a normal center of a normal central central centuries.
And also, these sources are intermitted,
The sun is not the whole thing that they are all the people who are all the time, and not the wind, and the wind.
So if you depends on these sources, you know, if you give them a way of heroes that when the source doesn't make it.
And he challenges us on the coast.
And distribution.
And we say that this energy source source, you know, this energy source.
They don't only need to do that, but they also do the risks of the risks from the outside.
And finally, the problem of the accuby.
To estimate the size of the problem, I analyzed all the people who are doing that, you know, with that, you know, you compared to that, you know, I compared with the world and I have been used to do that, you know, all the backs are going to be able to do it,
So we need a big deal with that, you have a 100 times the people who are going to use.
which is not impossible, but it's not very simple.
And this problem is manifests when the sources "intermitted" -- they say, 20 or 30 percent of the people who are talking about.
And then you get those sources for 100 percent, we need a miracle bacteria "miracy."
But how advanced on this street? What is the people who are doing it?
Is it an Project Manhattan? What does the problem?
You know, a lot of people who are going to tell you about it.
We need to have people in each of these people who are faces.
Many of the people who are going to define them.
And I think here, in the TED, many people are working in these fields.
Bill Gross-year-old, who was a Solar advances in the solar Solar advances in solar.
Vinod Khosla is investing in the dozens of people who are doing this, and they have been working with.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are going to tell you that, you know, the nuclear road.
There were some innovations in the branch, the nuclear weapons.
But from a little bit of a little bit of it, that there are some good people who are going to have to do that they don't have to be so much,
The idea of Earth's idea is that you can just burn only part of the uranium -- 235 percent of the uranium, we have to speak at 238, 99 percent of the uranish, in a certain sense.
For the truth if you were a lot of them, but it's never been adequately proved if you work out there or not, you can do a simulation and see that yes, and see that yeah, with the materials.
And because you burn 99 to the uranium, you know, the best costs that they are better on it.
They burn the boxes, and they use how combustible the bodies of the reactors, from the problem that they go from the problem with it.
It consumes uranium as the combustion procees.
It's like a straight of wood that burn that burny comes to progressive.
From combustible the problem is the problem with it.
Here's a place in Kentucky.
This is the download, 99 for the urania, which was taken the part of the uranish, and so it comes back to it, and so that they are impoor.
And they would tell you how they were going to have to do the chairs.
And you can filter the starts with an economics, there would be enough commitment to the life of this planet.
Many challenges us, but this is a lot of challenge, but this is a lot of people who do it to progregrew up with it.
How do we have the progres?
And they should they have the push to the push them?
Identirely the got, and then we take the pass intermedium.
You've got to talk about an 80 percent reduction of 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's very important to do it in the time.
20 percent is going to be the poors, and from a little agriculture.
At that point, you hoped to the deforestation and the deforestation and the cement.
And so you know, 80 percent, you know, nations like China, including nations like China China, they reported the people who were talking to them.
The other people who are we doing this zero-hemission?
We actually put it in practices in the nations that you do that?
What are we spread else?
It's an important one.
It's a key to the pagella.
Again, who do that, you have the page 202020?
You know, you have the two aspects.
We are going to implementing the measure of efficiency to do it.
Men employee will be the total of CO2 and so the temperature.
But the vote in this material, do things that they don't have big reduced a fish or even slightly inferry, or even slightly inferration of the innovation of innovation.
and we have these speed progress all speed, and we can get the speed from that, and we can deal with regulated rules.
A lot of good enough, they were going to tell you that.
The ones of Al Good, "Turch," and David McKay, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."
They have a context the problem and create a context in which they wouldness, because these things necessary.
A lot of things that they were contemporary to me.
So I have a little bit of it.
I know that invented that invention that inventing technology necessary.
If I had to have to do it for the last 50 years, I translated the president of the country, you know, a vaccine, which is the people who are doing that, you know, and it doesn't produce CO2 -- and it doesn't produce the CO2 --
It would be that with more impact.
If this is that I don't like that, you know, the sentence between who thinks very short and people who are going to be terrible, and the China, between the people who are going to be terrible, and if you have a little bit of the people who are going to be able to tell you.
Anyway, do we do?
What I'm inviting you to take the beginning, and proceded?
It's necessary about the research.
When the countries reached in the people are going to be like Copenhagen, they shouldn't just talk about CO2.
They are going to argue the innovation of the innovation and stupid to do it in these things that we do in these things that they do in these people who are doing it,
We need incentives on CO2 poses on CO2, the "cap and traded, and the training.
It spreading the message.
And this is more rational dialogue, and you know, including the government.
It's a committing, but I think that I do it.
and they do it.
and they do it.
Chris Anderson: You know,
Just to know more on Earth's Earth, except --
Woman: Do you give them the size of investors?
Bill Gates: Bill Gates: Realizing the software, assummarizing all the big things that we have a lot of millions -- and even when you get the material in a reactor reactor, to be sure that they can be safe with.
And the thing is, you know, the pilots of billions of billions -- the competent authorities, the competent authorities.
Once you get the first, if they added it, it will be the Colombo, because the costs, the density of density -- and the density of speaking.
CA: So, if I understand this implements the construction of the building, of a vertical fuel full of nuclear fuel, of this kind of uranium.
It starts at the bottom to the bottom of the bas?
BG: Yeah. The reactors, you know, the people who are all the people who can not work. They are going to go and do --
It's not benefit!
If you have the combustible is very cheap for 60 years old, put it up and forgot it and forgot it and forgotten and forget get all those people in the people who are doing it.
Reste there, burning for sessed years, and then it ends up.
CA: This is a nuclear weather is a nuclear disorder.
BG: Yeah. Yeah. You can leave them and then you can leave them up, and you can get them into another reactor and burning them.
And it starts with the reflowing back in the vass of cooling or in cooling or in the reactors.
They'll be our first fuel.
So what was a conventional reactors will be the conventional reactors, and the volume, and the volume of reducing reducing reducing reduced.
CA: But when you speak to the world in the too, where it reschool, where you were going to be able to do it?
BG: There's no place, there's no place, and there are all these interesting rules of transparency rules about everything that is defined nuclear weapons, very interesting.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I have to have the Secretary for Energia.
We have a lot of the idea of how they do it.
I'm optimistic. Francent and Japanese have done in this field.
It's a variation about something that has been done.
You know, this is a sustainable kind of reactor, but it's a kind of reactor, so many countries have already built up with a fast reactory is a quick reactor.
CA: In fact, what are the time and the odds and the probabab?
BG: You know, one of these things that produces energy, which produces energy, which is not about 20 years to build it.
It's this scaffee that the environmental skills to be tasative.
Thirruppower, if everything is going to do that, it could easily easily satisfied this object.
And now there are, fortunately, dozens of people who are in the sector, which is if they do it, you know, they are going to deal with them, and they are going to company.
And this is a lot of these things happens, because at that point is going to remind a little bit of a speaking.
It's necessary that you have.
CA: They speaking of important innovations -- this is the biggest you know?
BG: One of the energy thing is the most important.
And it would be even without the environmental winds, but the environmental win the environmental walls the fact much more important.
We have other innovators.
We don't have the jobs like that, but one is the nuclear weapons, a different thing to it.
There's a reactor to the liquid re-to-to-to-to-to-to-town.
There are funny, but the basic is that a little bit of uranium is that a little bit of uranium, and you say that if you can deal with, you know, if you can deal with the negative aspects of the negatives -- you know, you have a classize, you know, a classize.
CA: And if it doesn't work, what do we do?
Don't you have an emergency class of emergency in order to senior stable temperatures, stable?
BG: If you're in that situation, it's a little bit like when you get too much, and you're going to have a charge.
Where did that point? You could need a surgeon or something like that.
And the whole thing about the so-called geooil, which are various techniques that they would slow heat doing us or 30 in which coordinary.
It's like to pull a insurance policy.
I hope we don't need it.
And the people who are not going to give you to the policy because you might be able to continue to go out because the surgeon.
I don't think it's a little bit of the importance of the problem, but now in the environment, but now in the geoking of the solutions in the audience that you have a little bit of revenues, or innovations come up with the preview.
CA: Clima-skeptical: if I had a sentence or two to say that they can persuade them that they have tor?
BG: Suncles are going to tell you about the skeptical scientific people who are very harmful.
You know, there is a negating feedback to the clouds that I'm going to go back to the warming.
They are very little, very few things that you can only say that there is a chance to do that, you know, the primary problem with AIDS.
And you put a mistake now and pay them for them to be very afterward.
And so, when you're taken from a thousand emergency and emergency to do the sacrifices --
sacrifices of not well-notes.
In the relationship of IPPC is not necessarily the other people who are in the rich world that you look at IPPC and says, okay, it's not then the bad.
The fact is that they are unable to do that, you know about action.
But my dream is that if you do that, if you do that, and respect the winds on CO2, and they tell me if you don't care care if you don't care CO2 -- I would like you don't care CO2 -- but I'm going to get it because it's more economically.
CA: And it would be this thing to go to Bjorn Lomborg, which if you invent all of your energy, you know, the CO2 things, you know, your other goals -- you know, they're going to talk about it, when they are going to do it, when they are doing it?
BG: In fact, the spectrum, you know,
We say the U.S., they should spend 10 people in the more than they do now is not so ingent.
You don't have to do that, if you destinated to others.
The things that people who are very good at it, and the people who were going to tell you, they are the anti-economic solutions.
And it is mostly that, waste.
Unless you that you don't know that they are learning the care of learning, I think that the effort, I think that the effort that the effort that they are focused in in that they have a constantly constantly.
If the alternate that, you know, we make the coast, so that only the recicives, all the people who are going to pay for it, all the people who are afraid to pay a lot of people who are willing to pay for it,
The disaster would be for two billion.
And Lomborg reviewed his positions.
His he is not talking about Research more than Research and Switch and Switk?"
And he still put it in the skeppers, but he's got a little bit of it, and so it is a lot of remarkable, and so it's suffering from Swild.
And this is one that I think it's appropriate it.
And it turns out that it is going to be able to do it.
CA: Beh Bill, I guess to the magician's magicians, by saying that I hope you can see the people who are going to tell you about it.
BG: You know,
And you know, I did a few months ago that I did a few months ago while I was writing an article for the Wired.
I always have my own speaking to the maybe, and I was writing at the time I wrote to you, but they already speed in the article and I've never been in my life looking at at it.
Let me read it.
"Disable," agaggetable," injury -- yrowed, decredated, lessly, smoking out of it, walls, despair, mainpoor, decreated, decreased, Senile, decreased by surrected, decreates by surrounded by the sursurface, uncles and weird.
Contrari: In form, strong.
I was reading this list at this list to a friend and at the time he was so ridicted, he was so ridicted, and I got to go to the shock and I had to tell me how to do that, you know, they were going to tell you how they were left to me.
We are obviously about an old to my old too.
I'm going to think that it is going to be.
But in fact, the data of building was in the 1980s.
When you start with the schools and learn how to do it and learning what what I think was out of the other kids and the world and the world and the people who were talking to me.
And he used, you know, to tell you that they don't have to do it at the time for that time.
I mean, from this thing that I was born in a world that I was born in a world that I don't have a good deal in the people who have been born at the time that my life has proced.
So, I'm immediately going to look at at 2009 in the networks, and they were very valuable to do it.
This is the kind of description.
Unfortunately, it's not very good at all.
And I find the last couple of people who are going to do that, you know, "inters" and "So, it's not just about the words.
is what we believe people when we give them with these words.
It's about the value of values, and how we build these values.
Our language affects our thinking and our thinking and our people and how they do it, and how they do them with them.
In fact, a lot of civilization -- including the Greek and that Romana, believed that Romana, believed that he was more powerful, because it would tell things about existence.
So, what it is, you know, a person who is limited to exist, or a person who is limited to exist,
You know, they do something that they do like to notice a person, and you give them the tapes and throw them up on their own.
Would you like to open the door for them?
One of the person who opened up the door was the doctor, I was the doctor in Wilmington Wilmington, Delaware.
His Dr. Pizzure.
ItaloAmerican, whose named it, it was going to talk to you about the Americans, so it has become Ph.D.
And the Ph.D.., he was always wearing fitted and a perfectly.
I would like to do that, you know, in hospital, with the exception of physiotherapy.
I had to do what it looks like. They had to do what they look like.
And I hated these elements more than any people are doing it.
I hated them and hate them and really hated them.
And I have to deal with it, like a Doctor, with Dr. P for Dr. P out of these exercizes, Innnness, Isles.
And it came up to one of my Stan's sedute Stanch and inexorable.
And he got me and he got me and Aimee, you're a kidn’t have to break up one of those phones.
"When the breeds, I'll give you 100 dollars."
Now, it was just a little bit of a Ph.D., to make the exercises that you don't have to be the most receivable to be the most receivable to give a different routs, and he was to give a different routternal orry.
and transforms it into a deal with me.
And I wonder to ask the entity of his face and his journy, and he redefined the way to me as a child, and he redefined the same as a stronger and athic person to the matter.
This is a kind of like adult position as adults as adults as adults.
But, in fact, in fact, with those definitions of the vocabulary mayms, our language, our language, our language that we all want to do it, the fact that everybody wants to see if the same as ables.
Our language has not been at the time to do with the changes of our society, many of which have been created by the technology.
And of course, from a medical point of view, my legs to the laser workers for the viewer and also recognizing that they are helping people to cooperate with their skills to cooperate with their skills with their skills, and it overwhelmed them with their ability, and they can identify that they allow them to identify the social networks, so they can identify themselves.
So, perhaps the technology is going to revealing more and the thing that has always been a truth that everybody has something that has something that is always a little bit of our society, and our greatest quality.
The humans of them, is something interesting, because people always wanted to talk about it, because people always wanted to talk to you and talk to you about it.
This sentence has never been there, and I always felt that I would always hear me in this way, and I think I'm starting to understand why.
It's about this phrase, insisted in this sentence, is that the success or the other side of a challenge of a challenge of a challenge of a challenge of a challenge -- if my job is to slavor or or the circumnmnavigation of a life with prosthice, or what people feel like my disability as my disability.
You know, we change -- we have changed, logically, from a challenge, because of a challenge or either.
And I would like to suggest that this is a town.
The adversity is not an obstacle that we have to add the way we have to advertise it.
It's part of our factory --
And I want to think it's like my ombra.
And sometimes the notes of the time you do it, but it's always with me.
And, of course, I'm not trying to decrease the impact, the weight of a person.
There are the challenges and the challenge and the challenge in all the single person, but the people who are going to deal with each single person, but how you go to deal with.
