Sinchallenge ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
Grups of four people have to build the highest possible tower as you can build the highest alone.
The marshmallow must be wallowed to the top to the top of the tower to the top of the top to the top of the top to the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top to the top of the top to the top of the top to the top to the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top
And, even though it looks very simple, it's pretty difficult, because the people to collaborate very quickly.
So I thought it was an interesting idea, and I incorporated it in a laboratory.
And it was a huge success.
And since then, I organized about 70 laborators of these kinds of these kinds of these kinds of the world with students, designers and architects, even research and development companies Fortune 50.
There's something in this exercise that reveals the lessons about the nature of collaboration, and I'd like to share some of these lessons with you.
Normal, most of the people are starting with the original compiece of him.
They're talking about it might be expect that might be expect for power, then they go through the planning.
They do skills and preavavails and preavavails.
They're going to take the greatest part of the long time is assembling the spaghi in buildings, at the end of the time is going to fall, somebody out the marshmallow, and falling it in the top and fall, make a step back and Ta-da!
They burn the job.
But what happens is really, most of the times of times is that the "Ta-da-shmallow -- because the sea weight of the marshmallow -- because the sea weight of the sea structure.
There is a number of people who have a lot more moments "uh-oh-o-h-to-ol business school.
But, they walked away, and they create absolutely transballs.
And there are of course groups that have a lot more structure," and in the best of childhood schools of childhood schools.
And it's amazing.
It says Peter, not only create the highest structures, but they're also the most interesting.
And your question is going to be able? What are you possible? What do they have to particular?
And Peter to say, "No one of the kids spend time trying to become the director of SpA." Right.
They don't spend time competing for the power.
But there's another reason.
And the reason is that economy students are formed to find the single best project.
And then you get it.
And then what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top, they don't have longer time and what happens?
The crisis.
Does you familiar? Right.
What children are doing differently, is that they start from the marshmallow, and build prototypes, one after each other, in the top of the marshmallow, so different possibilities of advanced prototypes.
The designers recognize that these kinds of collaboration is the essence of the process.
And with every version, children have a feedback of what works and what it doesn't work.
So the ability to work on prototypes, it's essential, but we see as different different groups.
The average for most people is about 50 centries, for economy, about 50 centries, for economy, about half of economy, about half, but not much.
Who does better than all?
Architects and engineers, thank you at the sky.
99 percent is the highest structure that I ever seen.
And why? Because they understand that triangles and the triangles and the models and the models are the key to build stable.
And then we have the general director of the media.
But that's where it becomes interesting.
If you include a right administrator delegation can do a lot better.
It's an amazing. You get a little bit back, and you look, "The Vedran that group will win antic. And why?
Because they have particular skills in advance.
They exist the process.
And all the groups that gestures and pray attention to the work of the team.
Does special and dots of agevolutation, and their combination to a success.
If you have 10 groups who usually well, you'll get structures that are going to get structures that are in feet.
And I tried an interesting.
I thought, well, let's stick for a time.
I put on the 10,000 dollars in software.
What do you think of design?
What was the result of it?
Here's what happened.
None of the team has created a stable structure.
If one of them had built a 2.5 house structure.
Is it not interesting that a little bit of an impact?
We tried again the exercise with the same students.
What do you think it's happened?
Now they had the value of a prototype.
The same team, from the worst has become the best.
They created the highest structure in the minute time.
So this is important lessons about the nature of incentives and the successfully -- why someone should spend time to write a marshmallow?
The reason is this: help to create digital instruments and processes to help groups build automous video games.
And what a marshmallow is to help identify to identify supposed to identify.
Why?
The challenge provides a shared experience, a common language, a common position to build a prototype.
And so, this is the value of experience, of this simple exercise.
And those of you were interested in the marshmallowchallenge.com.
It's a blog where you can give a look at how marshmallow.
There are patterns for step.
There are examples from all around the world about how people correct and address the system.
There's also the record.
And the most important, I think, is that design is really an contact sport sports --
It turns out of all the sense of all the senses, and the reasonments and the manuality and manuality to manage the challenge that you have in a hand.
And sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that is necessary to transform a "uh-h-o-h-o-h.
And that can actually make a difference.
Thank you very much.
We ended up having a machine, beautiful, beautiful TED, it's a time.
Everybody in this room.
You can go back, you can go back, you can't stay where you are.
And I'd be curious to know what I'm going to choose -- because I asked my friends in the last few times, and everybody wants to go back.
I don't know. They don't want to go back to the cars or Twitter, or "American Idol."
I don't know.
I'm convinced that there is a kind of return to our algies, illusions.
I understand.
But I don't do part of that group, I have to admit it.
I don't want to go back, and because I don't want to go back, because the possibilities on this planet doesn't go back, go away.
So I want to go into the car and I want to go on.
This is the best time that there was on this planet in every field that we can measure, healthy, health, mobility.
There was never a period like this.
My great-grandmother, everyone about 60 years, before 60 years.
My grandparents spent that 70.
My parents are to touching 80s.
So it's better that there is a nine at the beginning of my years at my death.
But it's not just about people like us, it's a much bigger than this.
A child born in New Delhi today can be expect to live as much the richest man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it. It's an amazing.
How do we make it?
Vaiolo. The smallpox billions of people on this planet.
It has changed the demography of the globe, as no war has ever done.
If you went to Svanite.
We disconfited.
In the rich world, diseases that threatened millions of people just have no longer in practice.
Like, rosolia, policy --
somebody knows what is it?
Vaccine, modern medicine, our modern ability to feed billions of people, these are triumps of scientific method.
And second me, the scientific method of scientific method of humanity; it's one of the great results of humanity.
These were the good news.
Unfortunately, they were the good news because there are other problems, and have been quoted a lot of times of times, one of them is that, although all we have, a billion people goes on this planet, every day.
This is growing is growing with amazing, and it's vergognow.
And not only we use our creativity to refill the planet.
Withen, land ground, growing rainforests, oil rainforests, oil -- they're disappearing. They are disappearing and they are disappearing. And if we don't innow.
So the question is, can we do that? I think yes.
I think it's clear that it's possible to make food to feed billions of people without violent the earth that they live in.
I think it's possible to figure this world without that this energy world.
I think, and no, it's not a illusion.
But here's the thing I wake up with the night -- one of the things that keep me up at night.
We've never had as a science of scientific progress, and we have never been in the location of how we could use them today.
We're at a step from incredible event, really, in many ambites.
But despite this, I think we should go back to centuries, 300 years, before the Illuminism, to find a period in which we fought the progress, a period that we had more vigorously, and more vigorously, and more vigorous than we do.
People mean to what you believe, and they do it with a lot of force that we can't get it.
It turns out the truth.
Listen, everyone have right to their opinion; they also have right to the opinion, but you know about the progress, but you know what you don't right?
You haven't say to your faces. I sorry, you can't.
I put it a little bit about it.
A decade of years ago, I wrote a story about vaccines for "The New Yorker," a short article.
And I was amazing someone opposed to what it is, after all, the most effective health of public health of all the most effective of all the human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I wrote the story, and I wrote the story, and I wrote the story.
Not much later, I wrote a story about genetically food --
Same thing, only bigger.
People were crazy.
So I wrote a story about that, and I couldn't figure out why people were considered OGM as "most," because they thought they would move the molecules in a specific way, instead of the molecules in a way, instead of nature.
But, I wrote my job. I wrote my work.
I mean, I'm a journalist: we send, sends up there.
But these stories torturned out and I couldn't understand why, but at the end I did.
The problem was that those fanatics who were doing not fanated.
They were consciousness, educated, people for well.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And that was a lot of --
But then I thought, we have to be honest; we're at a point, on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship with progress that there was a time.
We're talking about the environment.
We talk in ironic terms using the ironic virgolet: "Progresso." Well, there are reasons to do that, and I think we know what they are.
We've lost trust in institutions, in authority, and sometimes in science itself, and it's understandable that has happened.
You just make a few names and people understand.
Chernobnobr Bhopal, Challenger, Viox, Challenger, Viox, expensive.
I mean, each one has his list.
We have questions and problems with people who thought we were right.
So you're skeptical.
Let's asking the answers, you pretend to experience.
You don't give anything for granted.
But here's the foundation, when the evidence is necessary to accept them, and we're not very good at that.
And I think that the reason is that we have in an epidemic of fear that I had never seen and hope I never saw and I hope I can't see it.
About 12 years ago, a story, orrible story, a horrible story that supported there was a bond between an epidemic epidemic and vaccines.
Very scary.
Hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true.
And they had to do hundreds of study; it's a important.
They came up with the data.
They came from the U.S., from the U.S., from the Sweden, from Canada, and everyone were equal, no correlationship, no correlationship, no correlationship, no correlationship,
It wasn't difference. It didn't make it because we believe the aneddoes, to what we see -- to what we see -- to what we think we can see, what it makes us feel real.
We don't think about a pile of document documents of the government that show us all numbers, and we understand it all.
But you know what?
The results have been to --
because this is a fact: the U.S. is one of the few countries in the world in which the number of vaccines against the death of vaccines.
It's horrible, and we should be true.
It's awful.
What happened that happened you to do something like that?
Now, I understand. I understand it.
Think about it, someone here has the morning?
Somebody in the audience has ever seen a person die of death?
It doesn't happen.
In this country, but this happened 160,000 times in the world last year.
I'm a lot of deaths for dead, 20 every hour.
But as Jenny successful here, we can take it from your head, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around to shoot messages of fear and ignorance messages like Oprah Larry King Live.
And they can do because they don't understand the difference between causality and correlationship.
They don't understand that these two things seem equal, but they're not almost may.
But it's something we have to learn, and we have to learn it quickly.
This man was a hero, Jonas Salk.
He has liberated the humanity from one of his flowers.
No suffering, no suffering, no suffering.
The man at the middle in the middle.
It's called Paul Offit.
It just created a vaccine against the rotable together with other people.
She saved 400,000 children every year in the developing countries.
Is it bad, right?
It's good, if it wasn't that Paul goes around to talk about vaccines, says how precious and people should just stop friend.
And it says in these terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul talks to a public audience can't testimony without an armate.
They call it at home because of some pleasy to remember him where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul has created a vaccine.
I wouldn't need to tell you, but vaccines are fundamental.
If we stop taking them, the disease come back, terrible disease, and he's happening.
We have the again this country.
And it's going to be worse, and between not a lot of the children will begin to die again because it's just a lot of numbers.
And they're not going to die of death.
Are the policy? Are that now?
A couple of my colleagues written me a couple of weeks ago, and told me that it was considered a little bit of it.
Nobody told me before.
She wouldn't vaccined his son against polyo.
No.
OK.
Why? Because there is no polio from us. But you know what?
We didn't have the polio in the United States.
And I'm not -- perhaps a guy -- maybe a guy is saliped on a airplane in Lagos Angeles, now is coming to Los Angeles, now is over the Ohio.
Maybe it will land in a couple of hours, will notice a machine, it will be here in Long Beach and stasery participate from TED.
He wouldn't be infected by a paralyzed disease, and we don't know because it's so that it works the world.
This is the planet in which we live. We don't do it.
We're going to address. We're going to do it.
Everybody tains on the morning?
Echinacea, a bit of antiossidants to start the day.
I know you did it because Americans of Americans do it every day.
They take that stuff, as they affer to the alternative medicine, and it doesn't matter how often it that are useful.
The data demonstrate seeds.
They get the best urine. More of this doesn't do anywhere.
But it's good, you want to spend 28 billion dollars for school.
By school school.
Why?
I think we can understand, we saw the big pharmaceutical homes.
We have the great government machine. We don't figure it.
And we do good. Our health care schif.
It's cross millions of people.
It's absolutely incredibly cold, incredibly cold.
So we get far away away from who?
We're going to be in the great placebo.
It's great. We love the great placebo.
You know, it's a serious problem because this stuff is a schip, and we spend billion dollars.
I have a whole series of examples.
No one of these -- a from, echinacea -- an echinacea -- I don't even know what it is but we spend billions of dollars, and it's a from.
You know what? When I say this? When I say these things, and they say "But what is interesting? Let me me that people do what you want.
It makes them well."
You guess what? Do you walk back.
Because I don't care about if it's the secretary of the Department for the Salute and Servizi Umani to say, "Uhm, I don't want to hear the evidence of the mammography or if it says it says the patients of patients.
When we stick the street that leads to replace science and evidence and evidence with magic and tradition, we end up in a place where we wouldn't be.
We start like Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
She killed 400 miles of his citizens continuing to say that barbaboles, cut and squarter-re-retrovirals that we know can slow down the decort of AIDS.
Hundreds of thousand thousands of deaths in a country.
Please, you don't get to tell me that there are no consequences for these actions.
There are simple there.
Now, the greatest epidemic epidemics right now is the war in the middle of the genetics of genetically modified and the elite of the biological food.
It's an idiatriba. It must end up there.
It's a diatriba, on the metaphors.
It's ideology, it's not science.
Every single thing that we eat, every chick of rise, every chick of price Bruxelles was modified by man.
See, there weren't hanging in the Eden.
There were no money.
There were no Natal trees.
We've done it in the last 1111-year-old.
Something worked and something else.
And we eliminated what it doesn't work.
Now we can do it more precise.
And there are risks, of course we are.
But we can insert things like lived in the rise, and this would help millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people.
And we don't want to do it?
I have to tell you, I don't understand.
We're against OGM.
Why?
The things that I hear is, we too many chemicides, pesticides, hormonocultures, we don't want to be amount with the same thing, it's wrong.
We don't want that companies.
We don't want that companies.
Do you know what my answer to this?
That's right. We're right. Let's do something.
It's true, we have a huge food problem, but it's not science.
It has nothing to do with science.
It's laws, morality line drives on shorts.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes gives you a positive result, but the idea that we shouldn't afford to do its science to do because we have afraid to prosper.
You know, in the next 50 years, we're going to be forced to produce 70 percent of what we produce now, 70 percent of what we produce now, 70 percent.
These are the investments in Africa of the last 30 years.
Vergo.
They need them and we don't get diam.
Why? Cibo genetically.
We don't want to encourage people to eat people like manioca.
Back billion people eat.
It looks a little bit. It looks like.
But it turns out just calories.
It doesn't have no nutrients, it doesn't have proteins, but scientists are finding the way of snutrients right now.
So a lot of people could eat less and run the risk of becoming sky.
They wouldn't die and you know what?
It would be very beautiful. It wouldn't be a restaurant, but it would be very beautiful.
I was going to wonderful: Why are we control?
I mean, do we call this thing?
Only why don't we want to move the genes and there?
It's about genes.
It's not about our ridiculous obsession for the hours, or of our bigger food.
They don't get the Rice Krispies.
This is about saving people, and it would be that we begin to understand what it means.
Why do you want to know? -- if we don't understand, and we keep behavior, we are going to be a lot of something that we don't think we want to be something that we wouldn't think we want to macchiar it, colonialism.
There's no other way to describe what is going on.
It's egoist, it's horrible, it's horrible, and we have to stop it.
So, after this funny conversation of fun, you might say, "Do you have to go into this ridiculous ridiculous time and go to the future of time and go to the future?"
Okay, of course.
It's stuck on the present now, but we have an amazing opportunity.
We can impose the machine of time as we want.
We have the possibility to go where we want, and we're going to get where we want.
We have to do these conversations, and we have to think, but when we go into the machine, and we're going to be happy to do it.
I know we can -- I know how I think that the world needs.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the chronist of Los Angeles Times Steve Lopez was walking for the streets of Los Angeles when he got a beautiful music.
It was from a man-American Afro-American Afro-American-American-American, fascinating, with with the seadows, without dead, who was a violin that he only had two crows.
I'm telling a story that a lot of you know -- because the Steve articles of Steve Look in a book, which, in the followed to the great screen, with Robert Downew, with Robert Downeed, with Robert Lopez, and Jamie Fox Lopez, and Jamie Fox in the Nathony Ayers, the contraft of Nathony of Steve Loathony Ayers,
Nathaniel lass like Juilliard, he had a terrible nervous, and 30 years later lived as a without touch, and 30 years later in Los Angeles.
I mean all of you to read the Steve book, to look at the film to look at the film to understand not just the beautiful tie that created between these two men,
I call Jane McGonigal. They're a video games.
I realize games online from 10 years, and my objective for the next 10 years, is to try to save the world in real life.
To do that I have a plan, and convincing more people, I understood all of you, to spend more beautiful games and interesting.
We have three billion hours a week playing online.
Some of you might think, "It's a lot of time spent to play it."
maybe too time, considering how many of the urgent problems we have to solve in the real world.
In fact, according to my research research for Futuro, actually is true the contrary.
Three billions of hours are not sufficient enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world.
In fact, I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we have to increase that digneeds to increase that did.
I calculated that we need is 21 billion hours of play every week.
It's probably an idea. It's probably an counterintuitive, so the rest of the concept.
If we want to solve problems that fame, the climate change, the climate change, the obesity, the obesity, the obesity, I believe we have to have the environment to play online, for at least 21 billion hours of the next decade. No, are serious.
This is why. This picture is because I think that it's so important to play is so important for the survival of the human species.
This is a portrait of the photographer Phil Toldan, he wanted to capture the emotion of game.
So he pictures of the players while they players players.
And this is an emotion of game.
If you're not abital players is possible that you losed some of this picture.
You probably notice the sense of urgence, a little bit of fear, but also a very profound concentration, a very deep attention to face a very difficult problem.
If you player-player-players around a few details, and around the eyes, and around the mouth are a sign of optimism.
And it takes it surprise.
This is a habital player to a step from something called "Epicaw."
Ah, it's a term you heard. Okay. Okay. OK.
So we have habital players between us.
A victory is an extraordinary result so extraordinary positive that doesn't seem to be possible until you get it.
It's almost beyond the leaves of the imagination, and when you get a shock discovering what you're really skill.
This player is at a epical player.
And this is the expression that we need to see about millions of problems in the world in the world as we face with the obstacles of the next hundred years' expression of someone which, against all the expression of someone which, against all the expectations, it's at a epicture.
Unfortunately, this is the expression that we see in the life of all the days.
This is the expression that I call "Brate Nella Realty. And I'm going to do it.
I am with the expression, "I'm not Bry."
This is a graffer in my old Berkeley, in California, where I did the PhD in California, where I did PhD in the real life.
And this is a lot of a lot of people players: we feel that we are not good as good as in games.
And I don't mean simply simply like success, even though the success is going to get more results in online.
But I mean bad in the sense of motivates to do something important, inspired to collaborate and cooperating.
And when we are in an online world, I believe that many of us become the best versions of themselves, the most ability to help without preavailable to help without prevent on a problem for the entire time, to get up after a failure and try new.
And in the real life, when we face a failure, when we face a obstacle, we often not feel like that we feel like this, we feel anxious, maybe depressed, maybe depressed or Chinic.
We never provide these feelings as a game, simply doesn't exist in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study to university.
What is in a game is that in a game that we can't get any result?
How can we transport those feelings and applying them into the real?
So I looked like World of Warcraft, which is really the ideal environment to solve problems.
And I started to notice some things that make the epic lives so possible in online.
The first is, when you open into one of these games, especially online, especially in World of Warcraft, there are many different characters that flows to save the points to save the world.
But not a mission mission: a perfectly mission: a perfect mission. Right?
So you can complete.
They're not going to give you impossible.
But it's about your skills. So you have to try seriously.
But there is no disoccupation in World of Warcraft, you don't spend time to turn the pollens, there's always something specific and important to do.
And there are many collaborators.
All right, hundreds of thousands of people, ready to join your epical mission.
This is not something so common in real life, this feeling that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there is this narrative epic, this narratives that inspire is there, and what we're doing.
And then we remember this positive feedback positive --
You've heard about increasing level and force, one of force, and intelligence in intelligence.
We don't receive that kind of constants in real life.
When I leave this stage is not going to talk about the front of an audience, and a different ideas.
I didn't get that kind of feedback in real life.
Now, the problem of collaborative online like World of Warcraft is that it gives so much satisfaction is that it gives all our time in these games that we decide to spend all our time in these games.
It's just better than reality.
This is which, collectively all of the World of World Warcraft have spent 5.93 million years to solve the virtual problems of Azeroth.
This is not necessarily.
But put it in perspective: 5.93 million years ago was the time in which one of our ancestors.
That was the first of walking and walking.
Okay, so when we talk about what we're investing in play, the only manier-sensory of thinking about it, is to talk about them, is to talk about the human evolution -- but also useful thing, but also useful, because we discovered that we're changing all of this time to play, we're changing what we're changing what we're going to have more heart and more heart.
This is true, I believe.
So you know this statistics.
It was recently published by a Carnagie Mellon.
The typical young medium today in a country in a country with a stronger culture of players will spend 10,000 hours playing online, at the age of 21 years.
10,000 hours is an interesting number of two reasons.
First of all, for the children in the United States, 10.080 hours is the exacact number of hours to school maturity if you're present every day.
So we have a whole whole parallel of education in which younger in which young people learn how to be the players to school.
And some of you will have probably read the new of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuoriclasse."
If you've got a read of successful theory of success, the theory of 10,000 hours for success.
It's based on an optima research in the cognition, that if we detect 10,000 hours of study fruitous in 21 years of genes in that field.
We'll be good at that something as much the best people in the world.
So what we have now now now is a whole generation of young people.
So the question is: "Exactly, what become good at these gate?"
because if we could figure out what we're going to have a amount of human resources of human resources.
This is the number of people in the world that are at least one day to play online.
These are our games.
500 million people who are extraordinary.
And in the next decade we have another billion of habital players that are extraordinary.
If you didn't know it, this is what you expect -- the video game industry, video games is developing platforms that consumed power and they work with the cell phone that will work with the Internet in India, China, Brazil players around the world, in India, China, Brazil, China, Brazil can connect online.
The estimate is a billion players in the next decade.
This will take us 1.5 billion players.
So I started thinking under what these games are transforming into genes.
These are four expects that I have individuals. The first is a very good urgent.
Okay. Think it as a extreme of self-motivation.
A optimism is the desire to immediately actly to deal with a obstacle, together with the convinction of having a reasonable of success.
The habital players believe that a victory is possible and it's possible and that it always worth of evidence, and to try it now.
The habital players are not with your hands.
The abitual players are virtuous virtuous with a social.
There are a lot of interesting research that show how we find better with other people after played with them, even though they were playing with themselves.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of confidence to play with someone -- we trusted that they are going to do with the same rules and with the same rules and obbirds and obbirds to the conclusion of the game.
So, to play together, build the bonds of cooperation and cooperation.
We really have a result that we really have more social social relationships.
My joy productivity. I love it. I mean.
You know, there's a reason why the World Warcraft player 22 hours a week player 22 hours a week work.
It's because we know, while we're playing, as we're playing, rather happy worked him, rather than we have time.
We know we are optimized, as a human, as a human, to work anything that has meaned.
And habital players are dispointed to work on constantly, if it's a adapt tasked.
Finally, an epic means.
The habitual players to be associated with wonderful missions and human-scale history.
For example, a little information to help create a context.
You know Wikipedia, the biggest wiki in the world.
The second wiki biggest wiki in the world, with almost 80,000 articles is World of Warcraft China.
They have more information on World of Warcraft in World of Warcraft in any other argument in any other wiki in any other wiki in the world.
They're building an epicture.
They're building a source of information in World Warcraft.
Okay, these are the four superpowers that together.
Ahabital players are individuals.
These are people who believed to be individually able to change the world.
The only problem is that believed to be able to change the virtual worlds but not real.
This is the problem I'm trying to solve.
There's a economy of Edward Castronova.
Her studies are brilliant. He's studying the reason why people invested so much time, energy and money, in online.
He says, "We're looking at what constituts nothing less than a mass on the virtuals and the environments and the environments.
And it's a cheaper, so it's rational and saying -- I'm not like me, I am a game, I'm exuberant.
But he says that this is a perfectly sense that this is a perfectly sensory of the online that in real life.
They can have more solid social relationships in a game that not in real life.
They have a better feedback and feel more feeling feeling more reward in a game that not in real life.
So, I mean, it's perfectly reasonable players for habital players that in the real world that in the real world that in the real world that this is reasonable to agree that this is reason for now but it's not in any way, a situation of the world that we have to start the real world more similar game. We have to begin to a game.
So here inspiration from something that happened 2500 years ago.
These are many ancients, facts of host of Prima to have a joysticks and butting wonderful clean extensively. And these are the first instruments of humanity.
If you know the ancient of the ancient historical written history.
It's the story of who invented games and why.
I was born that plays, particular, particularly the games of the guys were invented in the Lidia, during a period.
It turns out that in the Lidia decided to do something impensible.
People suffering, the population was at a summer situation.
So, second Erodot, they invented the game games and emanded a valid law.
One day, everybody would have eated.
The next day everybody would have played.
And they diving so profoundly in the game games, from the moment to play is so involving us in a joy-productivity, that they ignored the fact that they have nothing to eat.
And so one day they would play and a day.
And second Erodot, they spent so 18 years old, surviving to eat a day and playing the follow.
I think that's exactly the way we use today.
We use games to get the soffering of the real world.
We use games to get away from everything that doesn't work in our real environment, from everything that doesn't work in our real life, and get what we need from the games.
But we don't need to stop here.
This is decidedly interesting: second Erodoing, after 18 years old, so the paper, so the decided that they would played a last wall.
They started the whole realm in the middle, and they played a game game, and the winner.
They let up the Lidia and went to look at a new land of a new land where to live, leave the number of people to survive with the resources of people to survive with the resources of their civilized civilization somewhere else, where you could provide civilization somewhere.
It's a little idea idea, right?
But it turns out of the DNA they revealed that the Etrusers that would have brought to the roman, shared the same DNA of the Lidia.
So recently scientists have suggested that the narrated story from Erodote is a real story.
And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that almost 20 years and that might explain the caresty.
So this amazing story might be true: they could have saved their culture playing, refugee in the game for 18 years to be so inspired as well as well as well as well as I met to save that the whole civilization.
Okay, we can do it.
We're at World of the 1994.
It was the first game of strategy in real time of the World Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
They played by 18 years, we played Warcraft for 16 years.
I say, we are ready for our epic go.
They had a half of the population of the population of a new world.
This is where I get the idea of 21 billion hours of play a week.
We make half of us to agree that half of us to play a day to play, until when we don't solve the problems of the real world.
Imagine what you're going to ask, "How do we do to solve the problems of the real world in a game?" Well, this is what I've dedicated my work during the last years, I took the Istitute for Futuro.
In our own Palo Alto we have this stendaries our idea of how we should relate to our idea of how we should relate to the future.
We don't want to predict the future.
What we want to do is -- the future.
We want to imagine the scenaries from the best results and then we want to give the possibility to transform them in reality.
We want to imagine lives to make epic epic instruments to make them.
I'm going to show you three games I realized games that I realized and I'm a attempt to create of the epic lives in their future.
This is "Mondwide."
We did this game in 2007.
It's a online online in which you seeks to survive to an oil.
It's not real, but we published, but we published sufficient online to make you believe that it is, and to make life as if we were at the section, you know, when you enter in the game, you have in the game -- and you have news that area of video data that shows exactly the cost of the oil -- the impact of the things that are not available, the impact of food distribution of food distribution.
Our impact on transportation, if the schools are closed, and you have to think about how you living your life. And you have to think about how you living your blog -- and you have to have a blog on a blog --
We had this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we looked at them for the three years, and what I can say is that transform.
No one wants to change the maniera where it's just a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a should do it.
But if you dive them in a epic adventure and says, "We've got no longer oil.
This is an amazing.
She says itself to see how to survive it."
Most of our players who learned in the players that learned in the game.
So, for the next thing I wanted to save the world, we decided to save the world, we decided to a higher problem than oil.
We did a game called Superperstruct, at the Istitute for Futuro, and the premise was, a supercomputer computed that humanity has only other 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputer was called "The Global of Allerte Estination of the Global Estination.
We've asked people to reach online almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer's movie.
You know Jerry Bruckheimer's movies a dream, I have an astronauta, scientist, the astronauta, the scientist, and everybody else to save the world, but in our game, but in our game, but in our game, instead of haven't got five people in the team, and it's the future of the resource of energy, the future of resource and the future of security and the future.
8,000 people played for eight weeks to eight weeks, incredibly creative solutions that you can find if you go online and look at Google.
Finally, the last game, the last three of marze. This is a 3-marzing game with the Istitute.
If I completed the game is going to be certified by the Istitute of the World Bank, like Social Innovator class of 2010.
Woring with sub-Saharan Africa-Saharan Africa, we're inviting them to learn the social techniques.
There is a story in comics, you increase level of levels like the local knowledge of local knowledge, the imagination.
Desider, all of you to sharing this game with young people, wherever in the world, particularly in the developing areas of the development, which may be benefits, which could benefits of the world to save the world to save the world to save the world.
It's now to conclusion.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think what happen?
We have all of these amazing players. We have these games that are projects of what we could do is, but no one of these has still saved the real world.
Well, I hope that you agree with me that habital players are a human resource that we can use to do some of the work in the real world that players are a powerful platform that we have these incredible superpowerful superpowerful productivity that we have these incredible superpowerful resource of a epic meaning.
I really hope that we can be met to play games that are important, to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that you join me in the realize and participatterns like this.
When I look at the next decade, two things are certainly, two things are certain -- that we can be able to imagine, and we can play anything we want.
So, I mean, let's take the games that are going to change the world.
Thank you.
For some time I was interested in the placebo effect, it can seem a magician effect of it, unless you consider that you don't consider it from my point of view is going to become something reality to become something real. And in other words, the pills of sugars, sugar effect in some studies, the sugar effect in some studies, the person thinks
which is happening is to have to be a drug or something like --
The sweet of the pain, for example, if they believe you have a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect.
Something is true for perception.
To figure that I want to show you a magic trick very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that is present in all the books.
I learned from only with Cub Sco-Magic Scout.
And so I'm going to extend to you and explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I explained.
This is what happens.
The color, you can examinate; my hand, you can examine.
I'm just going to turn the color in my pug, like this.
I am on the hand.
To be safe or saves from my hand.
Now weird my poly."
So you can see that something that you ever see something that can go on or down to my hand.
And the purpose of that is simple.
I go to open my hand, and if everything has gone good, my magnetism is going to open the cola.
In fact, it remains to his place that I can school, and the color doesn't fall.
Nothing goes on or out of my hand.
There's no trick. You can examine anything.
Ta-da!
This is a trick that often cheap to the children.
that are interested in the magic because you can learn a lot about the ingage to study this trick even though metodologically is very simple.
Many of you in this room.
Here's what happens Tengo to my hand.
I say that I saw my wright.
to make sure that cloud or saving out of my hand, this is a good thing.
The reason I keep the pole is because it's the secret of illusion.
In the moment when my hand moves moving away from you, this fingtandoses here, my indeed, he moves from while, in a position.
There's somebody who didn't have a childhood.
This is from there, right.
And when I turn the finger is moving.
We can talk about why it's ingannel, because you don't notice that there are only three fingers down because the mind, and the way that information doesn't contain, one, two, three.
But that's not the point. Right?
And when I close my finger, same thing, when I walk back, this movement to go back.
The hand. hand.
It's a trick you can do with your friends and close. Thank you.
Now, what has to do with the placebo?
I read a study, a year ago, a year ago, a year ago.
I'm not a medical researcher, for which was a surprising.
It looks like that if you looks like a placebo in the form of a white pill of a white aspill, just a white pill, a white pill. It has a measurable.
But if you change the shape and you give the placebo, in the form of a smaller pill, and blue printed a literally more effective.
Even though none of the two has no drug sugar.
But a white pill, the white pill.
What? Do you really wall.
But by the way, it's not the end of it.
The capsules are more effective than every form.
A capsule.
The dosage has a role.
A couple two times a day is not as effective like three pills. Now I don't remember the statistics.
But the point is,
-- that these dosages have a role.
And it also has a role.
And if you want, you have to use a ago.
Right?
You start it in a patient --
This is a strong image so strong in their mind, much stronger than the white pill.
It's real, this graphics -- I'm going to show you another time when we have slides.
The point is that the white pillle is not effective like that blue is not as effectively as a ago.
And nobody has a pharmaceutical quality.
It's just your believing that makes them in your cover.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and applying it to a magic trick.
And do something that is a trick and make it seem real.
And we know from the study that when you want to use the ago.
This is a seven inches of seven inches.
This is a little bit.
This is my carnice. This is not Damian.
This is my skin. This is not a special hollywood.
I'm going to bucket my skin, and to move this ago until the oppoint.
If you tried nauseful -- if you get easily -- I did for some friends in the trego, the other night, and for some of the woman.
So if you try nauseful easy, I suggest that you don't look for the next 30s -- in fact, I'm going to do the first bad part here.
You can see, you can see, you can see from another part.
This is what happens, right here, the beginning of my arm at the bottom of my arm, I just make a small bull.
Do you use it?
And now a little through my skin, and out on the other hand, like this.
Now, we're in the same position.
More or now? But you can't count my finger, right?
So here's one, two, two, three, four, five --
I know what people looks like when I seeing it.
They think, "Sically, it's not going to be stupid bucket just for a different minutes."
So, let you let me give you a swall.
Are you going to be good.
Yeah, I know that there are behind "Okay, I don't saw it well."
People in the rooms are wrong.
Let me show you.
This is really my skin. It's not a special effect of Hollywood.
This is my carne, and I can turn it around it.
Sorry, if you feel bad and you feel bad about another part, you don't look at all.
People in the bottom or going to look between a few years old, "Well, it's clear that a few effect, but if it was true --
You can see there's a hole here and a hole here, if it was true blood."
Well, now I get out a little blood for you.
Here's here.
And in order to leave the ago.
I would like my arm, and I would like to see that there are no ference.
But I believe that in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and turn it into something that I'm going to let it is, and I'm going to go from the stage.
We're going to see them in the next day. I hope you can't see the right now. Thank you very much.
So, in my life, I met a lot of fish.
I only loved two.
The first one of a passional story.
It was a beautiful fish beautiful fish, consistent one of the smart on the menu.
That fish!
What even better, as a best farming farmed standards of environmental standards of the environmental standard.
So, you hear with consciousness to sell.
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for different months.
A day, the head of the company called me and asked me to talk about a dedicated event of the environmental sustainability.
"Of course.
This was a company that he tried to solve what has become a unimaginable problem for our cheap.
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu?
During the last 50 years we have fished in the same way we have the soil forests.
The destruction has been tremendous.
90 percent of the great fish, the ones that we like so the tonn, the halibut, the halibut, the heavens are reduced by number of number.
There is almost nothing about it.
So it turns out of water or less water, the fish, it will become part of our future.
There are a lot of arguments.
The trains of the fish, for the least most of themselves, and they're inefficient. You take the ton for example.
A great problem is that there is a food of 15 to one.
This means that it means that it takes 15 wild wild fish to get a book.
It's not very sustainable.
And the power is not a great challenge.
So this is here there was a company that was trying to do it in the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The first one of the event I telephone cap of the audiences of the company.
Let's let Don.
"Don," I said, "How much to understand well, you are famous to do so far ahead, in the open-a-house."
"Exact," he said, "We're so far away from our shot that our scarts are diluits, not concentration."
And then add "We're practically a particular world at all."
"The rate of conversion? 2.5 to a one."
"The best in sector."
2.5 to one, fantastic.
"2.5 to something? What do you eat to fish?"
"The sustainable protein say.
"Great," I said, "Like.
The night, I was at night, I thought, I thought, you know, he's a sustainable protein it?
So the next day.
I said, "Don, do you have some examples of sustainable protein s?"
He said that I didn't know it, and he would be asked around around here.
Well, I talked to a few people of the company, and no one to give me an answer.
until I talk to the biologist.
We him Don.
"Don," I said, "Do you have some examples of sustainable protein s?"
Well, he mentioned a few algalg algae and then said, "Pollollo."
I said, "Pollollo?"
She says, "Yeah, thought, sand shot wall, swecked up and processed to eat."
I said, "What's the percentage of your eat is made of pollo?"
I think, say, the two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent."
I said, "What's sustainable in giving the chicken of the chickens?"
There was a long pauses on telephone and then said, "There are just too chickens in the world."
I saving this fish.
No, because I'm not one of those virtuosis of good food.
Well, to say that truth. I are.
No, in fact, I disamount of this fish because, you know, the fish.
The second fish is a different.
It's a romantic story, that kind of story that the fish and most knowledge.
I eat him for the first time in a restaurant, in the south of Spaper.
One of my journalist had talked about this fish.
She had done us to met us.
He came to the table had a brilliant white color, almost swing.
The chef had taken it too much.
Basically, the double of how it had to be cotted.
Incredibly, it was still deliver.
Who is able to be able to make a good fish so good after the street?
I mean, but this guy yes.
Let's call Miguel.
It's actually called Miguel.
No, it wasn't a fish, and it's not a chef.
For lessly, not in the sense that we mean by it.
This is a biologist in Veta biologist of fish in the corner in the corner of the Spain to the Spain to the Spain of the river.
As the '80s, the early 80 the crows.
They had bovens on what before was essentially was a paludox area.
They had given the earth building an intricated series of conwanting to the water in the river.
Well, they couldn't make it works out what not from the economic point of view.
And, from the ecologist, it was a disaster.
He had killed something like 90 percent of the birds and looking at the place, it's a lot of birds.
So in 1982 an company, in 1982 company with an environmental consciousness.
What do they do?
It turns out of water.
Literally invert the interruption.
Instead of convolving water from the ground, they use the channels to the channels.
They mean all the channels.
They created a fishing of fishes from 27 miles of the spigs, rangers and inversus and in this process, Miguel and this company, Miguel and this company, the ecologic destruction.
The farming is incredible.
I mean, you never saw a thing like this.
Look at the horizonte that seems to be a million miles and everything that you see are the inones and this recognize and this recognize.
I've been there little time ago with Miguel.
This is an amazing three quarter Charts Darwin and a quarter Crocode Dundee.
Okay? We're made in the middle to this lague, and I had the fanger and Miguel, and Miguel, he had his biology.
First of a white nibe.
And then it explains the needs minerals of the fito's fitoes that remembers that the reminds of the Tanzania.
It turns out out that Miguel has spent much of his career at the National Park in Africa.
I asked them how it was becoming a fish.
He said, "You know? I don't know anything fish.
I'm an expert in relationship."
And he sweet up after it turns out of rarks on rars, algae and plants.
Don't well, this was very fascinating, which was very fascinating thing, which is like biotic community.
It's interesting, but I was indeed, but I was in love with it.
And my head was continuing to thinking about that delious fish.
So interrupts and I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish so good fish so good fish like that?"
He indicated the algae.
"I know. I know, the algae, the faitos, yes, it's amazing.
But your fish what are they eat?
What's your food conversion?
Well, it answers to me how they would be a rich system so rich that the fish eat exactly what they would send in an environment.
The biomass of plants, the stoplankton -- that's all of the fish.
The system is so in health that is completely.
There are no eat.
You've ever heard of a farming that not gives to eat his animals?
More tardi, I was driving around the earth with Miguel and I said, "In a place like this looks like so natural so that it seems so natural that has ever seen to measure the success?"
At that moment, it was like if the regist of a film had the change of the set.
And we looked at the corner and we saw a scene between the most incredible thousands and thousands and thousands of phencopters.
"This is the success," he said,
"Look to their bloods.
They're bank you.
Banchetting? I was completely confused.
I said, "Miguel, but they're not banching with your fish?"
"Yeah.
"We're about 20 percent of the fish and the eggs of the bird.
So last year on this properties there were 600,000 birds over 250 species.
Today has become the biggest and one of the most important health of the biggest birds in the Europa."
I said, "Miguel, but a bird population of bird bird is not the last thing you would like in a fish of fish?"
You know the head, no.
He said, "We're going to take extensive extensive.
This is an ecological networks.
The phencopters eat the legs.
People eat the fitoplankton.
So more is the system."
Okay, then we measuress that it's not giving to eat his animals and that measures his success in the health of his predators.
It's a fish, but also a healthcare for bird.
Ah, in proposite, those phenicopters shouldn't even be.
They do the nest in a 150 miles where the soil conditions of the soil conditions of the soil conditions.
Each morning, they flying for 150 miles and get to the floor, and they make 150 miles for the back.
They do it because they're able to follow the white line.
On the seriously.
I could imagine something like Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, they flying for 150 miles to the farming and then 150 miles of night to go back?
Do they do it for their small?"
He looked at me how if I just quoted a song of Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, do it because food is better."
I didn't talk about the skins of my loved fish that was deliver, and I usually not like the skin.
I don't like a abbit, I don't like crossing.
It's that knowledge.
Don't cooking it almost before.
And yet, when I asked it in the south of Spain south of the Spainting of skin.
He had a sweet sweets was like giving the ocean.
I said to Miguel, and he annued.
He said, "The skin is like a spug.
It's the last defenses before anything in the fish.
It's evolved to keep the impurity."
And then add "But our water has no impurity."
Okay. This is not to feed his fish.
A farms that measures its predators of its predators of its predators.
And then I realized that when he tells that he says that the water is not very much the water than the water that fluid in that fluid in that that fluid is a river, which is a river, which is a river, which is a river, which is a rivers that the rivers tends of pesticides.
And when it goes down the system, and the water is clean than when it's good.
The system is so in the healthy water.
So, not just a farming farming that doesn't just have his animals not just a farming that measures his success in the health of his predators and health of his predators and not just for those fish and not just for those fish and not just for those fish and for you.
Because when water water comes in the Atlantic.
This is a drop in the ocean, but I know the well, and so you should be able to do why romantic love for how romantic love.
You could say that it's a recipe for the future of good food.
And what we need is a radically new agriculture of agriculture in which food has really good know.
But for a lot of people, this is a little too radical.
We're not realists, passionate of food.
We're loving.
We love the little agricultural markets.
We put the small familiar farmers.
We talk about local food.
We eat biology.
And when you say that these are the things that will make sure the future of good food and says, "Hey, you know, "Hey, even to me like the red food and says, "Hey, even to me like you think, but how do you think we could feed the entire world.
How do you think we can feed the world?"
Can I be main?
It's a question I don't like it.
No, because we produce not because we produce enough to feed the world.
A billion people suffering the hunger today.
One billion -- more than we ever -- because of the enormous amount of the enormous amount of the distribution.
See, I don't like this question because he determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years.
Our the pestics of pestics to the world's chicken chickens to the chickens to the fish, and all this period of the agricultural industry has just asked "If we could feed more people, what are we going to do that?"
This was the motivation.
It was the justified.
It was the business of business of the American agriculture.
We should call it for what it is, an industry in the liquidation of an industry that is fastly erodd the capital that makes measurely possible.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our panimal today is not because of providence in declines, but for the resources in declined not for the last invention of mechanics, but for the land for the fertile, not for the fresh water -- but for the fresh water -- but for forests and not for the weighs and not for the weighs, but for the forests in the sea.
Do you want to feed the world?
Let's beginning to ask ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that connect to every local communities to feed?
To do that, we don't look at the model of the future.
It's a model and stank.
It's all about capital, chemistry and machinery, and it never really produced anything good to eat.
We look at the ecological model.
This is what counts about two billion years of the job.
Let's look at Miguel, as Miguel, as Miguel, and farm that are not closed in whether they are not only deployed farmers that rebuild instead of consumption that only extensively instead that only extensively instead that only instead that only experts in relationships, because they are the people who are also experts in the knowly.
If I have to be truly better than I can ever be I.
You know, at me good, because that's going to be the future of good food, it's going to be deliver.
Thank you.
I grew up with a further basic diet.
At high school, I would take a school hours and back every day.
And I was always immersed in a book of science book, which was bringing my mind in other worlds, and satisfaced in a narrative form, that insatic inaware that I had.
And that curious curiosity was also in the fact that every time I wasn't at school out in the wood, excursions to hunters and samples of agnings, insects and several sects -- I brought them to the microscope.
I was a real geek of science.
But it was always trying to figure the world, understanding the limits of possible.
And my love for phantom, in reality seemed to be respect the world around me, because what was going on in the earth 1960s, we were going to go on the moon, we were going to explore the depth of the oceans, Jacques Cousteau was entered in our reality with his wonderful documentary that showed us we wouldn't imagine.
So, everything seemed to make my passion for science.
And I was an artist.
I knew to draw. I knew painting. I knew painting.
And because there weren't video games this sature of film generated to computer, or all of these pictures in the average of the media, I had to create these pictures in my head.
From a children, when we read a book, we all had to put something on the screen on the screen of our tests.
And so, my answer was painting for alien creatures, alien creatures, robots, robots, navicells all this stuff.
The lessons of mathematical lessons I was drinking behind the textbook.
This is because creativity had to find a while.
And it happened -- Jacques Cousteau Jacques Cousteau I was very much for the fact that there was an alien world right here on the earth.
You may not be going to be going to go into a alien world.
It was very unlikely.
But that was a world where I could be true, right here on the earth rich and exotics of what I would ever imagine that I would ever imagine,
So, I decided that I would be going to become a 15 years.
And the only problem was I living in a little country of Canada, to 600 miles from the ocean.
But I didn't left flow.
I assilled my father until he found a school in Buffalo, New York, I just spent the border where we live.
And so I managed to take the certified in a YMCA in the winter in Buffalo, New York.
And I wouldn't seen the ocean, for two years, until we moved in California.
Since then, in the last 40 years, I spent about 3,000 hours underwater, and 500 of these hours in submersibles.
And I learned that the depth of the ocean, even the deep ocean's recognize of our imagination.
The imagination of nature is without respect to our human imagine.
Again, I'm intied by what I see when I do the immersions.
And my love story with the ocean continue to the ocean.
But when I choose a career, I chose to do films.
It looked like being the best way to concile this smany to tell stories with the smania to create imagines.
And as a guy, I would draw costly comics and so on.
So to make film was the only way to put together and stories.
Everything came back.
And obviously the stories that I chose to tell are stories of science, "Aliens," "Aliens" and "The Aliens."
And with "The Abys" I unished my love for the depth of a film.
So, I've got the two passions.
He says, "The Abys" came out something interesting that was to solve a narrative specific problem in that film, that creature creature of liquid water creature of liquid water with the computer.
And so he was the first character surface and animated to the computer that was ever seen in a film.
And even though the film is not made a lot of money, I would say that to hard, I've been tested by something extraordinary, all the audience, all the audience.
You know, it's the law of Arthur Clarke for which every technology officiently advanced by the magia.
They were seeing something magic.
And that emotioned me a lot.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is something that needs to be adopted in the film."
So with "Terminator 2," my next film -- my next film --
Woring with the Industrial Light and Magic, we created the guy in that film. The successful depended on the film. The success.
And it worked. And we have a magic.
And we got the same result with a audience.
But we had a little bit more with that film.
So, by tracking a line between these two points of experience, I came to the conclusion that this would be a whole new world of creativity creativity artists.
So I put up a society with a society with Stan Winston, which was the main Winston, which was the principal trick and designers in that period, and we called it Digital Digital Digital Domain.
And the principle of society was to let us to the past, the analog press opties and so forth, and go directly to the digital production.
And so we did a competitive advantage for a little bit.
But we're standing back to half of the '90s in the 1990s, which is what we had founded up the society.
So I wrote this text called "Avatar" with the intenance of push on the visual effects of visual computers, with emotional person, with emotional characters and realistic charactered to computer, and all the main generated computers.
And the whole thing was stayed to the myth.
The guys of society told me that we're not going to be able to do it for a little bit.
So I slipped it and I did this film of a big ship.
And I throwed him there as a "Romeo and Giulietta on a ship.
It would be a epicture of epic, a passional movie.
Segretly, what I wanted to do was immergery to see the "Titanic."
That's why I did that film.
And it's truth. I didn't know.
But I convine. I said, "We're going to immerge it to the relit. We're going to get it from alive.
We're going to use it for the beginning of the film.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a fantastic."
And I convinced them to financial expedition.
It looks like crazy. But this brings back to the imagination that it makes reality.
Because we really created a reality and six months later, I found on a Russian and a half of depth in North Atlantic Atlantic from the Atlantic, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in the definition, but for real.
I was sleep.
And it turns out a lot of preparation, we had to build figured and light and a lot of other things.
But I was flowed by those deep immersions, it was like a space missions.
Where everything was highly technical and rechieded huge planning.
You put it in this capture, you go down in this hair, where there are no hope to be saved to be savail, where you can't go back.
And I thought, "Fantastic. This is how to live in a science movie.
It's really amazing."
And so, I was from the depth of the exploration of the depth of the ocean.
Of course, curiosity, scientific component.
It all. It was all.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't off.
Of course, I could imagine a creature and create a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I saw out of the god.
In our next hydrothermal expeditions, I saw with hydrothermal open and sometimes that I had never seen before, things that no one had ever seen before, that actually weren't even described by science to the science.
So I was all about this and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, put my newspaper of Hollywood, and I do the Hollywood, and I do the explorer for a while.
So we began to planning these expeditions.
We found out of the Bismark and exploring it with robotic vehicles.
We went back to Titanic.
We took small robots that we had created with the optical fiber.
And the idea was to go inside and make a survival of the ship, which had never been done.
Nobody had ever looked at the inside of the relittle, and so we created the technology to do it.
So I looked at the Titanic, sitting on the Titanic, sitting in a submersible, looking at the asses that seem like these, where I knew that they had sounded violinists.
And I'm driving a small robotic vehicle through the corridoes.
When I tell you, I'm driving, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically present within the Titanic.
And it was the experience dejudence that has ever experience, because I had ever lived because I had already before I had to turn the corner that the lights of the vehicle of the vehicle for months.
And the set was based on a replicity of the ship.
So it was an absolutely amazing experience.
And it really realized that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experiment experiment these avatar robots, the mind is injected in the vehicle of existence.
It was very deeper.
And it might be a little bit of what may be going to happen between some decadecade when we start to have cyborn to have cyborn for some kind of plac-future exploration or other kinds of the future that I can imagine, from the science.
So we did these expeditions, and it really started to appreciate what there was subt, like the open of the depth of the depth of the ocean animals.
In substance, they're aliens right here on the earth.
They living in a chemosynthesis --
They don't survive in a system based on the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight on the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight.
So, you see animals that live close to water water at 500 degrees.
It even looks like not impossible.
At the same time I was interesting a lot of space science, one again, is the influence of the science, from girl.
And I ended up in the space environment with NASA, sitting in the consultive of NASA, to planning the NASA, to plan biomedge missions of the pre-cosmonauty, and all of these things, and all of these things, and all of these things, and all of these things, until to the international spatial station with our 3D.
It was fascinating.
But what I ended up to do was to bring the space scientists with us.
And bring them down because they could have access -- -- astrobiology scientists, people interested in these extremendous environments to these extremendous extremendous extremendous tools and so on.
So we were turning documentars, but we actually had science, space science, space science.
I had closed the range between phantom, from girl, to do those things to be true.
And you know, during this course of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot of science. But I also learned a lot about leadership.
Everybody thinks that a regist should be a leader, whatever.
I didn't know anything about leadership before to do all those expeditions.
Why do I have to saying, "What am I going to do that?
Why am I doing? What do I remember?"
You can't make all these spectacles.
We're hardly going to go to part.
People almost people think that I went to "Titanics and "Avatar" and "Avatar" and I was sleeping chicken.
I did all of these film, all these documentaries for a audience.
No fama, no glory, no glory, no money. What are I doing?
I am doing it for the task of the challenge -- and the ocean is the biggest challenge that exist, for the brilliance of the discovery, and for the brilliance of people form a team profoundly company.
Because we had all with 10-12 people, and working together, working together.
Sometimes for 2-three months of files.
And in that legam, you realize that the important thing is the respect that you have for them and they have for you, when you finished a task that you can't explain anybody else.
When you go back to the Earth and says, "We've got to do this, and the optical fiber, and the optical fiber, all the technology, and the spread of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect that perhaps only have to explain it. That's the police and knows that they can never explain it.
Creating a bond bond of respect.
When I went back to do my next film to do my next film -- I tried to apply the same principle of leadership is to respect the team and changing the team and change the team and change the team and change their respect.
It's really changed dynamics.
And so there was still once with a small group, in the inexplored to do "Avatar," with new technologies that didn't existed before.
Terribly emotional.
Tremendously.
And we became a family, in four and a half.
And it completely changed my way to do film.
People commented by saying that I've taken from the ocean and I put them on the planet Pandora.
For me, it was the way to do business, the process in itself, which was changed.
What can we can we take it now?
What are the lessons we learn?
I think the first curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing we have.
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest reality.
And the respect of the group is more important than all of the world in the world.
Young regists come up to me and say, "On me some advice to do this."
And I say, "Don't ponetimes.
Other people will do it for you, I don't make themselves, you don't realize against yourself.
And you have risk."
NASA is always telling this sentence, "The error's not contemplato."
But the error needs to be an option in the exploration, because it's like to do a save in the vacuum.
And no important attempt that required innovation has been done without risks.
You have to be willing to run these risks.
This is the thinking that I want to leave you, which is that in whatever you do, the error is an option, but fearly -- thank you.
If I wanted to understand a single idea would be that the set of the data that we consume is more than its sum of his parts, and instead of thinking about it. And instead of thinking about how to use the information to make new relationships so we see new relationships.
Here you see some statistics of organized mortality.
This instrument that I use is a little experiment.
It's called Pivot, and Pivot, and Pivott can filter a single cause of death, let's say accidents.
We see new relationships emerging new relationships.
The reason is that here in the central part of the central part of the most fragile.
We can make a step back, and reorganize the data because of death of death, we see that circulators and cancers and cancer are the majors and cancer.
If we go away and film for the age 40, we see under 40, we see that accidents are the causes of death I worry.
See closer than for men.
So you've got to visualize that information and data in these way is a little bit like swimming in a sea of swwall.
And if we can do it with raw data, why can't we do it with the content?
For example, we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated Sports Illustrated print.
Everything in the network.
You can go into your rooms and try you.
With Piving a decade.
Or a specific year.
It can be isolating a number in particular.
For example, we take athletes.
I'm a fan in LArmstrong, so I click here and I see all of the numbers in which looks like LArmstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a look like, "Why don't I look at all the cycles all the cycle?"
I do a step back.
And I see Greg Lemond.
You have to realize that when you navigate between the information in this way closer to go away and forward, it's not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not just a browser.
But you do something else different.
It's a half of a half of a second that we can use information.
We still have this idea that it can seem a little bit crazy.
We've taken every single page of Wikipedia, and we reduced it in a small let that consists in a small leap and an icony that indicates the tematic area.
I just show you the first 500 between the most visited Wikipedia.
Even in this screen, we can do a lot of it.
It turns out what tematic areas of Wikipedia.
So the government of the government point.
Like this option we see that the Wikipedia more often associated with this voices are "Personages of Time Magazine.
This is significant because it makes it emerging something that in the pages of Wikipedia.
And you see it just by doing a step back to see the together.
If you take one of these riass can then zooming on the categoria "Personages of Time Magazine.
and see them all.
And so I see most of government comes from government is from government in the world of the science of the science of the world of business.
Here's my head.
It comes from music.
And, quite interesting.
So we saving all the winners of my TED.
For the first time, we're really navigating in the network as if it was a network, but at a level of high abstraction.
I want to show you another thing that you might surprise you.
This is the New York Times.
Pivot, this application -- we don't call a browser, because it's not a browser, but it still is to see the Web pages -- we add this technology for the zoom to every Web, like this.
I can make a step back, and he can come back to a specific section. This is important because the only see the Web pages so show me all the way my navigation in the same identical well.
I can zoomare about what I did in particular moments.
In fact, you see the state of the state of the deception I just presented.
I can see other things that I've seen in the day.
If I want to take a step back, and see all I can get my story or the story of my research.
Here I tried to look for the motor Bing the motor Bing Labs Pive Labs Pivot.
And from here I can zooming on my web and simply running from here.
One metaphor reuse a lot of times, and in every case the result is more than the result of the party data.
Today, in the world, the data has seen as a kind of a bunch of sick.
It talks of information.
It's talking about range in the data.
And if we put it all subject if we put the web underwater on the Web, instead of passing from one thing to the other, we used to see the structure that otherwise we can see the structures that otherwise can we see the structure that otherwis?
And then instead of hearing us in the data we could really extract information.
Instead of concerned about information, we can pull out of knowledge.
And by knowledge of knowledge.
And with that thank you.
From these days all talk about happiness.
I asked to contact the number of books, the word "happiness" in the title and published in the last five years, they stopped to contact over 40, and there were many more.
There is a huge of interest on happiness, between the researchers.
There's very "coaching" about happiness.
Everybody would want to make people happy.
But although, all this flow work, there are a series of cognitive traps that somehow cognitive that in some way make it impossible elaborate ideas correct on happiness.
My talk about today about today is especially about these "cognitive traps.
And about it is people who think about their happiness, and about their happiness, and look at studying happiness, because we share that we confuses like all others.
The first of these traps is the reluttance to admit the complexity.
It turns out that the word happiness is no longer a word useful word.
I think that you can restringing to a particular significant but in the line of massive, we're going to have to tell us about this accection and we have to adopt the most complicated vision of what well.
The second traps is the confusion between memory and memory. It's based to choose between being happy in life and happy in life and be happy in life.
And these are two concepts of different concept of happiness.
And the third is the illusion of the focus is unfortunate that we can't think about any circumstance of the well-being without distory about well-being without distory.
I mean, it's a real cognitive trap.
and there's no way to do the right thing.
I would like to start with one example of one person which, after a session of questions and answers and answered a story.
It's not clear ...] Disse that while he'd listened an absolutely magnific music right at the end of the registration of the registration.
And then added it in a very emotionally emotional that had rolled the entire experience.
But it wasn't true.
What he was the remind of the experience.
He had lived the experience.
And he listened for 20 minutes of the wonderful music.
but that he didn't count because he stayed with a certain -- I remember; the remember was sunning, and the remember was.
What this episodium, is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two of other people in terms of two "y."
There is a slide of experiences, that lives in the present and you know the present, and it is able to revive the past, but it has only the present.
This is about the experiences that lives the experiences and the doctor -- you know when the doctor ask -- you know when the doctor ask here?"
And then there is the reminds," it's about the "feels that you remember the points, and it's about the story of our life, and it's that the doctor, and it is that the doctor?
or anything like your journey in Albania?" or something like this.
Those are two different entities, the feels that lives an experience and what if you remember, and what if you remember, the confusion of happiness.
This is that remember, it's a cantic.
And this process starts with a fundamental answer of our reminds -- it starts immediately.
We don't tell stories only tell stories when we decided to tell them.
Our memory tells us stories, whatever, what you can be our experiences is a story.
Let me start with one example.
It's a old studio.
It reports the experiences of two patients during a sweet procedure.
I'm not going to get me in detail. It's not even sweet today, but it was painful when this study was sweet in the 1990s.
He asked the patients every 60 seconds.
And here is the results for two patients.
Those are their results.
If you ask yourself." Who has suffered with it?"
It's a very simple question.
Clearly, the Patient B: The Patient B:
his colony hit loud more and for every minute of sweweet suffered from the patient As the patient of the patient of As or more.
But now there is another question, "How much these patients think about avail?"
and here's the source of the Patient As had a remember of the colony of the larger of the Patient B.
The stories of the colony stories were different than a particular part of the procedure is the way in terms of the procedure is particularly positive -- but one of the two is different -- one of the two is particularly -- one of the two is particularly worse of the other.
And the worst is that where the pain was the final moment.
It's a negative story.
How do I know it?
Why do we asked these people after colony later, and even at a time, and even distance of time -- how much negatives has been the experience.
And it turned out out of the worst for B, in the order for B, in the remember.
So this is a conflict conflict between the spaces and experiences.
From the person of the experience that lives the experience, is clear that has suffered great.
So what you could do for the A, and we actually have clinical experiments clinics, and it was really done, and it was really doing it, and it may be extend to the colony of the Patient As maintaine.
This is a little bit of pain in the patient in the patient, but just less than before.
And by doing this for a couple of minutes, the experience of the Pati's experience. As it will be worse -- and the handle experiences.
How do you call a story?
And this is true for stories that are from the remember that for the stories that we invented a story, are the change moments and final.
The ends are very, very important and in this case, the final has dominated.
So, the sames that lives the experience lives his life in a continue.
It has moments when you live experiences that suspector what happens to these moment?
And the answer is simple.
They're allowed to say that most of the moments of our life -- as I calculated them -- I mean that in a life, psychological says hard about three seconds of the Most means that in a life, we connect about 600 million. In a month if they count about 600 millions of which are not left trace.
Most are completely ignored from the sames that remember.
And yet in some way you have the feeling that should count, that what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
It's the limited resources that we're spending while we're in this world.
And how to spend it, it seems to detect it, but it's not the story that reminds for us.
So we have a slides that reminds and an experiences that are pretty different.
The biggest difference between two is how to treat all.
From the point of view that lives the experience, if you go to vacations, and the second week is funny as a week of two weeks is two weeks is two weeks is a week of a week.
But this is not absolutely the way that I remember.
For the sames that remember, a two weeks is a week of a week of a week of vacation because there are no new remembers in addition to adding it.
You don't have changed history.
And in this way, the time is the critical variables that distusual is that remember of experiences.
The time has a limited impact on this story.
Well, the same, the saming experiences more than remembering and tell stories.
It's actually the fact that it takes decisions because, if we consider a patient that has happened, for example, two coloning with two different doctors and we decided what two different docks, what the doctors is what the remind of the doctor, and that will be the rest of choice.
The experience that lives the experiences has no voice in these choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experience, but between the remember of those experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future as experience.
We think we think of our future as ancient.
In fact, you can think of this situation, like a tyranny, and you can think of it, and you can think of the same, and you can think of how to turn the knows that lives the experiences through experiences of any experience that lives the experience that lives the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of it.
I have a feeling that when we go into the vacation is often the case that you have a good part of the service of the service of our slides that remember.
And this is a little difficult to justify.
Okay, how do we consume our memories?
This is one of the explanations.
When I think about that, it comes to me in mind of a few years ago, which is one of a few years ago, which is one of the best vacation of my life, and I think about relatively often vacations.
And I probably spend thinking about that journey of that journey of three weeks to say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I ever have opened the sign with the 600 photographs of the journey of the journey. This is three weeks of journey and a half of a hour and a half. It looks like a well.
Well, I could be a little bit extreme -- I could be a little bit.
Why are we going to fish memory respect to the weight that we have the experience?
I want you to think about a experiment with thought.
Imagine that during the next vacations, you know that at the end of the vacation of the vacation of all photographs will be destroyed, and you will take a medicine for the amnesia while you don't remember anything.
What if you would have a different vacation? And if you could choose a different, you create a conflict between two slides and you have to think about how to solve conflict and you have to think about how to solve conflict and in terms of time, you'll have a answer.
And if you think in terms of remember, you could get another answer.
The because we choose the vacation that we do, is a problem that makes us in front of the two of the side.
The two notions of happiness.
There are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use, one for each other.
So what is the experience?
And then you wonder: how happy are the moments in the slide?
And it's about -- happiness for moments it's a complicated process.
What are the emotions that we can measure?
And, by the way, now we are able to make us good idea of the happiness that lives the experiences in time.
If you ask about the happiness of the teams that remember, it's a completely different.
It's not how happy a living person alive.
This is how satisfaced or compleasy is the person when it thinks to his life.
It's a very different.
Everybody is not going to be able to distinguish these two notions, it's not to create confusions of happiness, and I appears to a group of well-being, and I appeared to a long period of happiness, which have shaped exactly in this maniera.
The difference between happiness, and experiences the experiences and experiences of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfact in the last few years, and there are now in the last few years, Gallup to measure the two separately, the Gallup has a world-a-millions of people have been subject on what they think about their life and their experiences.
And there were other studies in this direction.
So in the last few years, we started learning about the happiness.
And the biggest lesson we learned, is that they're very different.
You might know how much a person is satisfaced with your life, and yet it doesn't tell you about how happy they are living their lives and the reverse.
To give you an idea of the correlation is about 0.5.
What does that mean that if you mean that if you mean that if you mean that if you mean that if you mean that if you mean you know about his heith?
Well, you know something about its height, but with a lot of uncertainty.
You always have a little bit of uncertainty.
If I tell you somebody thinks that his life is at the eight in a scale from a ten one to 10 to you will be very uncertainly uncertainly about how experiences.
So the correlation is low.
We have a certain knowledge of what controls the satisfaction.
We know that money is very important, the goals are very important,
We know that to be happy means to be satisfacts with people that we like, to spend time with people that we have.
There are other pleasures, but these are the primary.
So if you want to massive the happiness of the two knows, you end up doing very different things.
The conclusion of what I've told is that we shouldn't think about happiness as well-being.
This is two completely different ideas completely different.
In more quickly quickly, another reason why we cannot think we can think in a linear happiness is that we don't take attention to the same things when we think about life.
So if you do the simple question about how happy people in California, you can't get the correct answer.
When you ask this question, think that you should be more happy in California, which in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contraster between California and other places and other places and other places and other places and other places --
Well, it turns out that the climate is not so important for the problem that lives the experiences and it's not very important to the hopefully that reflects that is what happy.
But because the sat is that reflects is in charge, you might end up -- some powerful people in California.
And it's interesting what is going to happen to people that turn into California in California in the hope of being happy.
Well, the experiences that lives the experience is not going to become happy.
We know it.
But something going to happen to be more happy, because when they think they're going to remember how terrible it was in Ohio.
And they're going to think about having the right decision.
It's very hard to think clearly about well-being and I think I had the idea of how hard it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question.
Thank you very much.
When we were at the telephone a couple of weeks ago, that a interesting result that an interesting result of the Gallup.
Is it something that thinks we can share that we still have a few minutes?
Daniel Kahneman: Okay.
I think the result of the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup is a number that we weren't expected to find.
We found that, with a reference to happy about the experience.
When we looked at how we feel various with the income, we discovered that, we discovered that under a 60,000 dollars a year, for American year, for American year, for Americans, on a very vast sample of about 600,000 Americans, in a very vast sample of a representative representative of 600,000 dollars a year.
CA: 60,000 dollars a year, 60,000 dollars a year, people are ununhappy, and they become progressively more unhappy as they become poor.
I mean, I've seen the rarely of the lines.
Clearly, what happens is that money is not buying happiness of experience, but the lack of money in experience, but the lack of money, very clearly, and we can measure that misery very, very clearly.
In terms of the other himself is, remember, it's another story.
More money.
This is not going to be emotions.
CA: But Danny, all the efforts of Americans are about life, the freedom of happiness.
If people took seriously this discovery, it practice it turns everything we believe, for example, the politics on the rates and so forth.
There's the possibility that politicians and politics, and the country in general, can take a discovered as that seriously and bringing a public policy based on it.
DK: You're that I think you recognize the role of happiness in the public politics.
The press of consideration will be slowed in the United States, but in the U.K., it's becoming reality, and in other states.
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about politics.
It will take us a little bit and people will begin to argue if they want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the valuable of life.
As a happiness to acknowledge different directions to how you think of how you think, and second you think of the slides that it makes the experiences.
All this affection will affect the politics, I think, in the years of true.
In the United States, they're doing some efforts to measuring the experience of happiness of the population.
And that, I think, it will come up with the next decade, maybe two of the country.
CA: Well, it seems to me like this argument, or for the less should be, the most interesting political discussion to follow in the next years.
Thank you very much.
Thanks Danny Kahneman.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate.
It can seem to seem strange in my job to the foundation of vaccines, things to invent and giving the world to help two billion people.
But climate and energy, in fact, are extremely importantly for this people, are more important for them than anybody else in the world.
A lot of climate matter, for many years old.
It turns out a rain or too long.
They're going to change that their fragile environment simply can't support.
which it leads to the fame. Ai conflict.
So, climmatics, they are going to be terribles.
Even the cost of the energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you can lower the price of one thing, to reduce poverty, to reduce poverty, to choose much energy.
The price of energy is down in time.
And a civilization progress to progress in energy field.
The carbon revolution.
And even in the 20th century, we seeing a rapid decline in the price of electricity that explain why we have frigerators, we can create modern materials and do so many things.
So in the rich world, we are as much about the electricity in a situation.
But while the price scenes, for example of the half of the CO2 emissions of CO2.
CO2 is the planet, and his equation is very simple.
CO2 empowered a temperature, which induces very negative.
Effects on climate, maybe even worse, indeed, in the sense that the natural ecosystems can't deal with these rapids changes.
The valutation of how you increase temperature because of a CO2, and as each one of CO2, and as each one of the two things, it's uncertainly, but not much.
And there is certainly uncertainty about how negatives will be extremely negative.
Do you know, I often asked to the best scientist: do we really have to reduce emissions.
We cannot just reducing them to a quarter?
And the answer is that, until we down to zero, the temperature will continue.
It's a great challenge challenge.
It's not like to say, "Let's do to spend a 3.5, under 3.5 miles under 3."
It's not about a whil."
This is a zero.
Now, we have a lot of CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons.
About 20 tons for every American.
For the poors of the poors of poor, is less than a ton capita.
The world's average is about five tons capital.
And somehow, we have to make progress that amount to zero.
The emissions are constantly at all.
Just some change economic changes have changed this tendency, so we have to spend from increasingly to the zero.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series of multiplications.
We've got the left, CO2, the CO2, who have to be onto the right, the average of the population, services that in average every person use, the average of every person use, the average of every person use, and the CO2 emers for energy.
We're going to go and see how we can see how we can do it.
Probably, one of these numbers.
It's about high school.
We see a while.
The first factor is population.
The world has today 6.8 billion habitants.
We tell us to nine billion.
If we do a good job with the new vaccines, health health reproductive, we can declined 10, 15 percent of the 10, 15 percent.
The second factor is the services that we use it.
The understanding everything, the food we eat, the vestarium, the TV, the warming.
They're wish, and free of poverty means to provide these services for almost everybody in the world.
And it's a good thing that this number of increases.
In the rich world, in the rich world, we probably could save and use men, but in average, every year, this number of salize.
And therefore, the amount of seriously, the amount of services.
This is a very simple example of service.
You've got the illumination in your house to do company, but these guys -- but these guys -- and they read and reading their companitors.
How much of efficiency -- E, the energy for the unity of services.
This is not increasing.
Thanks to a lot of inventions, new ways of illuminate, automobiles made differently, by many services can declined to a lot of services can declined energy.
In some services you can reduce 90 percent.
There are other serious services, like fertilizers, or the airplane, where the margins of improvement are very, very infertilizens are very, very infertilizers.
So, complessively, in the best consumed energy can be reduced by three perhaps to six times.
But these early three factors reduce emissions from 26 in the best of the cases, maybe 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
Let's look at the fourth factor, the key amount of CO2 embodies for energy.
The question is, can we reduce it to zer?
If you burn.
If you burn natural gas, no.
Almost all of the ways to produce electricity today the renewable and nuclear CO2.
So what we're going to have to do on a global scale -- that's to create a new system.
And we need energy miracohics.
Col terms of "mirac," I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. The person is a miracle.
Internet, and his services, I'm a miracle.
People here have participated the creation of a lot of miracles.
We usually don't have a scadence, a date within which I think you have miracle.
At the money, it's at the window and something else.
In this case we have to drive all the speed, and make a miracle in very short ties.
I asked myself how to illustrate this concept?
Can example of natural examples that caught the imagination?
I took a year ago, when I brought to the mosquitoes, and people found it fun.
He made them of the fact that that, in the world, there are people who live with mosquitoes.
This is my idea for energy.
I decided that to fly flying light would be this year my contribute.
Here's the lights here.
They tell me that not point, they could not get out of the boat.
So now we can invent ourselves like this, but not going to be help.
We need solutions, one or so many that they are, who are going to work on great scale and very affified, and although it's exploring in many directions, I think that just five can surprising effects of important.
I looked like the bong, the geo-combustic, nuclear fusion nuclear fuel biocombustible.
They could also give some contributes, and if they can do more than I expect that I expect me expected that we have to work on each of these five, and not snone of these five, and not snone of those five, because all the challenge challenges.
We're going to go for the first fossil fuel fuel, carbon or gas or a natural gas.
Here's our task is simple, but it's not, and it's not to capture the CO2, after the combustion, to the U.S.D., and to hope it up, put it somewhere, and hope that we can stay it up.
There are experimental technologies that capture 60 percent of CO2, 80 percent of CO2 percent of CO2 percent will be very complicated and it's going to be difficult of agreement on where I share all of this CO2.
The most spinous issue of the long term.
Who will be?
Who has something that is literally billions of times more voluminous than every other kind of imagine, like nuclear or other?
It's a huge volume.
So it's a difficult problem.
The other source would be the nuclear.
But nuclear presents three big problems.
The cost, especially in very regulated, it's high.
The issue of safety security that nothing can go wrong wrong, sick the slides of human operators, and that the bustible combustible.
And how do you manage the scores?
Malgrado the amount of redoctor, worry.
People need to be sured.
Three very difficult problems, so that you could solve, and on what you should be work.
The last three of the five sources.
These are the people that often definitely.
And to say the real advantage of not to require a combustible combustible combustible.
The first is that the density of energy produced with these technologies is decidedly inference.
This is about "collecting energy, and so many kilometers of square kilometers of a thousands of times more extremendous electric central electric central power.
And it turns out these sources.
The sun doesn't shapes all day, not all the day, not all the day, and the wind suffers.
So if you depends on these sources, you have to find a way to find an electrical power even when the source doesn't produce.
Gred challenges attending us on the front of the costs.
And the distribution.
For example, let's say that this energy source is outside.
So not just need technology, but you have to do the technology, but you also have to do the risky connection.
And finally, the issue of the accumulate issue.
For estimate the size of the problem, I analyzed all kinds of bacterial batteries today -- and whatever, I confronted them with the amount of electrical energy electrical energy electrical energy electrical energy that all of the bacteries now in production could be able to produce less than 10 minutes of all of the energy.
So we really need a big advance, a hundred times respect to the approaches now in use.
which is not impossible, but it's not very simple.
This problem is already when the sources "intermitt" produce more dels, say, 20 or 30 percent of consumption energy.
If you go to those sources for 100 percent, we need a miracle battery battery.
But how are we going to add this street? What's the right approach?
Is a Project Manhattan? What could you solve the problem?
A lot of companies at hundreds and hundred to work.
We need at least people in each of these five sectors.
Most of them, looking at them, call them crazy. This is a well.
And I think that here, in the TED, many people are already working in these fields.
Bill Gross different companies between which an eSolar that an eSolar that vanta-old technologies.
Khosla is investing in the dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting things and potential potential, and I'm giving my support at all.
Nathan Myhrvold Myhrvold a company, following the street of nuclear --
There were some innovations, modular nuclear -- modular nuclear --
But from a lot of time, the sector, the sector, that there are some good ideas around is not so amazing.
The idea of Terrapower is that, instead of burning only the uranium, the U235 percent of the available, we decided to burning the U238, 9999 percent of the U238, 999999 percent of it.
For the truth if you talk about a long time, but it's never been adequately tried if it would work or not, just because of the modern supercomputers today, you can do a simulation and see that yes, with the right materials, with the right materials, it seems to work.
And because it turns out 99 percent of the uranium, the structure of the best costs.
They burns burns, and they use as a fuel combustible today, from the problem that they were, from the problem that was, a source resource.
It turns out the uran-while combusting fuel combuston.
It's like a feet of wood that burns. It is called progressive.
From the point of the combustible problem is solve.
Here's a picture of a place in Kentucky.
This is scared, 99 percent of the uranium, which has been taken the part of the uranium, which is called a combustible.
These energy would give them energy to the United States for centuries.
And by filtering the seawater with a economic process, there would be enough combustible for the rest of this planet.
So a lot of challenges attended, but this is an example of hundreds of ideas that we need to progress.
How should we measure our progres?
What should they have to count your pays?
We're the objective, and then we value, and then we value.
You've heard a lot of people talking about 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's very important to be able to be able to do it.
20 percent of agriculture.
At that point, we have solved the deforestation and production of cement.
To get to 80 percent, therefore countries, including countries like China, will have to replace completely their electrical production.
The other question is, are we doing this technology to zer?
Do we put it in the developed countries?
What are we spreading it even else?
It's a important.
It's a key element of the page.
Would you go back to the page of 20?
And that should have the same two expects.
We should be implementing of efficiency measureductions.
We employ, minor minor is going to be the total amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this matter, doing things that not behaviorate big reductions, or even until, or even slightly inference to the innovation of new inventions.
We have to push these progress, and we can measure the speed, and we can measure the speed of regulations.
Many good books have been written about it.
David McKay, "The choic," and the David McKay, "Sustainable Sustainable Without the Hot Air."
These books beyond the problem and create a context in which to get the debate.
A lot of things have to have contemporary.
So I have a wish.
A very concrete wish that we have the technology necessary.
If I had to choose one wish for the next 50 years, I can choose the president of the country, the realization of a vaccine, which I have a lot, or to make this thing that cost half and not make CO2, or you can't make CO2 this last ma.
It would be the greatest impact.
If this wish is not going to do it, the fraction between who thinks and who's long-terrible, between the U.S. and China, among countries and rich, the life of those two billions of people will be going to be long.
What do we have to do?
What I'm inviting you to take the initiative and proced?
It's necessarily to research.
When countries get together in places like Copenhagen, they shouldn't just talk about CO2.
They have to talk about the innovations, and stupid how much we can invest in these innovative approaches that we can invest in these innovative approaches.
We need incentives, taxes on CO2, the "cap and trade," instruments that evidence the cost of the pollution.
We have to spread the message.
We have to make this more rational.
It's a challenge, but I think able.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you. Just to know more about Terrapower on Terrapower --
first of all, you can give us a idea of investment?
Bill Gates: Read the software, to buy the supercomputer, assumption all of the great scientists, what we already did, requires just tens of millions, and even when we have tested the materials in a Russian reactor of millions.
The difficult thing is to build the pilot, to find out various billions, the place in which is going to be built the first one that will be built the first example.
Once we built the first one, if it works like announced -- it's going to be the Colombo, because the costs, the density of the nuclear energy that we know today.
CA: So if I figure that well, this imples the construction of a vertical combustible combustible nuclear fuel.
And then the process starts from the high and progress towar?
BG: Yeah. The reactors, today, they come continuously, lots of people, lots of controls that can not work, openness, things that come and exactly --
Okay.
If the fuel combustible is very economic and you can do it for 60 years, put it in and forgotten all of the complexity.
It turns out there, burns and then finished.
CA: A nuclear nuclear implanting that makes out of itself!
BG: Yeah. Well, you can leave them up there, then you can let them into another reactor.
And we're going to begin with the existing rejects, now conserved in the vases of cooling or containers close to reactors.
They'll be our first fuel.
So what was a problem of conventional reactors, and the volume of the nostris, and the volume of the refused to impression, not just this process will be reality.
CA: But when I'm talking around the world of the potential of this technology, where is more interest interest to its realization?
BG: Well, there's not a place place in particular, and there are all these are interesting rules on everything that is defined nuclear -- and so interest.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I just met the Segretary for Energia.
We've talked about how this idea became to the current program.
I'm optimist. French and Japanese did in this field.
It's a variation about something that has been done.
This is a substantial improvement, but it's a quickly reactor that a lot of countries have built a very good candidate reactor.
CA: Are you have, what are the time and the probability that something like to do you realize that?
BG: Well, for one of these projects at the entire scale that produces energy, which is not very, we talk about 20 years to design it.
This is the scadence that the environmental models,
Terrapower, if everything good, which is not wonderful point, it could easily this goal.
And now, fortunately, fortunately, dozens of companies in the sector, if their research works, if the fundaments for their pilots for their pilots of piloss of their pilots of piloss in the sector.
And it's better if a lot of solution will have successful, because at that point, you can remember to a set of solutions.
It's necessary that at least a success.
CA: Would you talk about important, revolutionary, this is the biggest you know?
BG: A energy revolution is the most important.
It would be able without the environmental win the environmental is really much more important.
We have other innovators.
We don't know their jobs like this, but one is the nuclear nuclear -- a different approach.
There's a liquid reactor. It looks hard to me to do that, but maybe they say the same thing of us.
So there are different different things, but the beautiful is that a molecule, a molecule, a million times more energy than a millions of times more energy than a molecule, if you can detect ourselves, the potential, the potential, the potential, in terms of effects on the environment, in terms of effects on the environment, in terms of the environment.
CA: And if it doesn't work, what do we do?
We shouldn't we start adopt measures to try and keep the temperature to try to maintain stable?
BG: If you find you in that situation, it's kind of like when you eat you, and you have a heart attack.
Where do you go to that point? You might have to have a surgeon or something like this.
There's a lot of research line, on the geo-engineering, which are various techniques that would slow down the warming face that would slow down to 20 or 30 years in which we coordinate the action.
It's like to stick a policy.
I hope not need.
Some people say that you shouldn't even work in the policy because you could be in the policy because you could be savailed to save you.
I don't think it's a choice, says the importance of the problem of the problem -- but now in the engineering of the solution of the solution of the solutions in the case that events precipitine, or the innovations.
CA: If I had a sentence: if I had a phrase or two to dir them?
BG: Well, unfortunately, there are different types of skeeping scientific argues.
Some people say that there is a negative feedback to the cloud of the cloud that they die the effects of warming.
They're very, very few things that you can only say that there is a probability on a million that you have this probability on a million that you have the major problem like AIDS.
You start a mistay and you paid the consequences only very later.
And so, when you're pressed by emergence, the idea of doing sacrifices that you see results that you see results --
He sacrifices to achieve not well.
In fact, the IPPPPC is not necessarily perspectives necessarily case. There are people in the rich world that looks at the IPPC and says, okay, it's not so bad.
The fact is that uncertainty should supposed to action.
But my dream is that, if we can make economic economically, and to respect the vince of CO2, then the skeptic skeptics, I don't care if you not emitem CO2, almost preference, but I will accept it because it's more economic technologies.
CA: You'd be that your answer to the reasoning of the Bjorn Lomb, which if you invest all your energies and trying to solve the problem of CO2, your other goals, will be sacrificed. And that will be sacrificed. And what do you mean to do it, it means to make it resources so stupid?
BG: Well, the fact and development --
We say that the U.S.A should spend 10 billion in more than they do now is not so excited.
It shouldn't distrate resources.
The things that behavior a lot of money, and here people are reasonable to deal of economic solutions.
For me to me.
Unless you funded up learning curve to learn curve to learning, close to the point where it's going to become very economic efforts are concentrated in technologies that have the potential to lower in technologies that have the potential to lower the costs.
If the alternative fosse: we make cost-cost-cost-rich powerful energy, all of the rich, all of the people can afford to pay the energy five times as much without changing life.
The disaster would be for those two billion.
And the Lomborg has seen his positions.
His argument is: "Why isn't you discussing more than Ricerk and Switnes?"
For his past, you still get it between the skeptics, but he realized that it's a fairly crawling group, and so it's hopefully.
And it's a question I think it's appropriate that I think it's appropriate it.
It's amazing how little you invest in research and development.
CA: Well, I think of the majority of the audiences of the audience saying that I hope to see your desire to become reality.
BG: Thank you.
I want to sharing with you a discovery that I did a few months ago, while I was writing a Wired.
I always have my dictionary of the synonymous, every time I write something, but I had already finished that I never in my life, and I realized that I never in my life.
Let me read you the result.
"Deat," aggettiared, unuseful, unuseful, unuseful, slicked awesides, extremendous, extremendous unced Indeboliting, handappeared, settledged by the circulation, settled by the circulation of the surrounded by the circulation cle and debols.
Contrari: In form, lucky.
I was reading this high list to a friend to a friend and at the beginning, it was so ridiculous, and I had to stopped my voice, and I had to stop out of shock and I had to stop from shock and the impact of these words have left -- and the impact of these words have left me.
You know, we're talking about one of my old dictionary.
I'm thinking, it's going to be an old, right.
But, in fact the building was early 80s.
when I was starting the elementary schools and learning what was out of my family and learning what existed out of my family and other children and the world around me.
And unuseful to say that, thank God I didn't use the dictionary of the synonymous,
I mean, from this explanation looks like that I was born in a world that you see someone like me as one who has nothing positive in any way for them, whatever, who has been celebrated for opportunities and the adventure that my life has procured.
So, I'm immediately going to see on 2009 in the network, expected to find a review without value.
This is the version of description.
Unfortunately, it's not very much better.
I find the last two words under the last two words under "inter." So it's not just about the words.
That's what we believe people when we get them with these words.
It's about valuable values behind these words, and how we build these values.
Our flu language our thinking and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, lots of ancient civilizations, including that Greek and the Romana, believed that it was more powerful -- because to say things else.
So, what do we want to bring to exist, a person who is limited, or a person with more force?
So, casually by doing something simple like to nominate a person, a child, we could put it on a baby, we could put them on their force.
Do we wouldn't we open to them?
One person who opened the doctor -- it was the doctor of that I was the docton Wilmington Wilmington Wilmington, Delaware.
His name is Dr.
ItaloAmericans, whose known was too hard to be very hard to pronounce for most Americans, so it became doctors.
And the door to wear doctor, and he had a perfect colored and he had a perfect clined to work with children.
I was almost whatever of the time I spent in hospital, with the exception of physical sessions.
I had to do what seem infinite repetions of exercizes with these big elastic, in different colors -- you know, to help build the muscle.
And I hate these elastic elastics anything.
I hate them hate them, really hated.
And, you know, I knew already, like a five of five years, with the Dr. People to try to get out of these exercizes, Inuan.
And, one day, it came to one of my seats and unexorables, these sites.
And he said, "Aimee, "Aimee, you're a child so lucky, I think I went to break one of those phases.
"When the break, I will give you 100 dollars."
Now, clearly was just a little handle of the doctor to do the exercizes that I didn't want to do the front of perspective of the second plan, what he did did did was the richest of a different shape of a different shape at a different shape of day.
and turn it into an interesting experience for me.
And I wonderful today, the entity of his vision, and his declaration about me as a fortune child, he redefined my view of myself in a fortunately, afterwards to the future.
This is an example of how adults with lots of power can inflaming the force of a child.
But, in the first one with those definitions of the vocabulary of the synonyms, our language of our language to evolved to the reality that everybody wants to see if we want to see if you like.
Our language, not at the step of changes of our society, many of which have been created by technology.
of course, from a average point of view -- my legs, my legs, the operations, the laboration of the head-ey-ey-ey-ey-eyed bodies that are helping people to cooperate with their skills, and move to the ability that nature's ability that nature has imposed to the platforms of the social network, allows of the social networks with people to identify their choices of declining with groups.
So, maybe the technology is revealing more clearly what has always been a truth, which each one has something rare and powerful truth, and the human ability to adapt our society, and the human ability to adapt us is our biggest quality.
The human ability to adapt it, it's something interesting, because people always wanted to talk about difficulty, because people always wanted to talk to me.
This sentence has never gone good, and I sented up in the answer to people to this about that, and I think I'm starting to understand why.
It's subject in this sentence, insurprisable adversity, is the idea that success, or happiness, is to reemerging from the other side of a challenge of this experience, if my success in life of this experience, if my success in life has come from a ability schiving or circumnavigate of a life with the protess, or whatever people like my disability.
But in fact we have changed, we have changed, logically, from a challenge, physically or both.
And I would suggest that it's a good thing.
It's not a obstacle that we have to add our life.
It's part of our life.
And I mean to think it's like my shadow.
Sometimes him, and sometimes almost for anything, but it's always with me.
And, of course, not stay trying to decrease the impact, the weight of a person.
There are adversities and challenges in life, and it's all true and relative to every single person, but the question is not if you have adversities or or not, but how you go to deal with it.
So, our responsibility is not simply to protect people to us.
And we do a damage to our children when we make them feel that they're not ready to fit up.
There is an important difference and distinction between the medical objective of being an amputed person, and the subjective of the society that I seen to me or not.
And truth, the only disability is that I had to face is if the world ever thought that I could be described by those words.
In our wishes to protect those that we loving a cold truth.
Maybe the model of looking at only to look at what there is in you and how to put it back to you, can indebuly more the subject that the disease itself.
In not to treating a person in the complete, not to understand its potentiality, we are creating another disease of disease in addition to the natural suffering that already.
We're effectively giving the value of a person in our community.
So we have to see through the disease and inside the human capacity.
And much more importantly, there's a relationship between those insufficiency perceived and our greatest creativity.
So, it's not at proposed to svalue, these number of research as something we want to avoid or whatever we want to eventually find those opportunities tell you in an accident.
So maybe the idea that I want to explain is that there is not what as to be able to be able to be able to be able to use a term of the lotation of liber, maybe even dance, perhaps also dance to use together.
And, perhaps, if we look at an accident, like a natural and useful, and we are fewer from his presence.
This year, we celebrate Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, and it was 150 years ago, when I write about the evolution, that Darwin has illustrated illustred, I think, the truth to the human character.
In another way, it's not the strong, it's not the strons that survive, and it's not even the smart, and it's not even the most smart, is the most smart changes.
The conflict is the genesis of cracking.
Darwin, by Darwin, between other things, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and developed from the spirit of the human spirit in transformation.
So, again transformation, training, is our biggest quality.
And, maybe, we don't know what we did, we don't know what we're made of.
Maybe that's what adversity gives us the adversity, a sense of your force.
So, we can get a gift.
We can re-imagine adversity like something more difficult.
Maybe we can see it as a change.
The adversity is a change that we haven't adapted.
I think the biggest adversity that we created is this idea of normality. Now, who is normal?
There is no normal. There is a typical. There is a typical.
And you want to meet those few grills if there is it?
I don't think about it.
If we changed this paradigm from one of how to get the normality to be able to be adigned, or potentiality, to be an adigrim of so many kids, we can understand the strength of so many children, and invitate them with communities with their precious community.
The anthropologists teach us that what we us, as human, as human, we always wanted the members of our community is to be help.
There is an evidence that in Olanda, 60 thousand years ago, they brought to the old trip of the old and subjects with hurts, maybe because of the experience and survival of these people was the value of the community of these people was the value of the community of the value of the community of the value.
A few years ago, I was in a market of citizone where I grew up in that red area in the north of the Pennsylvania.
and I was standing in front of a puzzle.
And I was summer and I had a bounds.
I heard this guy, his voice behind me and said, "It's not Aimee Mullins." And I took me -- and there is this guy of half age. I had no idea of who was.
And I said,
I mean, when we met up with your mother."
GOh, that guy.
And, but of course, I was playing a field.
That means was the Dr. Kean was a man I had just given to the stories of my mother on that day, because, clear, because clear, clear, typically, I came back to two weeks.
And so, the kneecologist of my mother had gone in vacations, so the guy who did me was an extractly complete for my parent.
And, because I was born without the lost, and I had a finger in this feet, and some of the finger, and some in that, he had to be the bad messaggered bad news.
She said, "I had to give this to your parents that you would never walked up in my children, and you wouldn't have the kind of mobility that have other children or no independent, and you gave me a bunch of independent life, and you've given me that I had told me that he told me that he had told me that he told me that he had told me that I had won my childhad.
that I had marched with the Girl Scout, you know, the Halloween, that I had won my board, that I had won my scholarships and sporting them and sporting them and use them, by teaching the students of his medicine school in Hahnemane and Hershey.
And he called this part of the course of the X, the X. The potentiality of the human will will happen.
You can have no progrid of how powerful it can be and as determinant in the quality of a person.
And the Kean's Kean continued to explain me and he said, "In my experience, unless you have been told repeated, and even though it is given a baby support, if it's left himself, a child come up."
You see, Dr. Kean has changed his opinion.
He realized that there's a difference between a medical condition and what each one can do with it.
And there was a change in my thinking during the years, if you had 15 years old, if I had 15 years old, if I had 15 years old, if I wouldn't have a second.
I was going to have that kind of normality at that time.
If you ask it today, I'm not sure.
And it's because of the experiences I had with them.
And perhaps, the change in me is happened because I was more than people who opened to me the doors of those who opened me to the door of those who obstacouled.
You see, all you need is a person that you have to show you the epiphysical of your potentiality of your potentiality, if you can give someone the key of their force, the human spirit is so rich, if you can do it and open a door for someone in the best of the ways.
You're taught to open the door open.
In fact, the significance of the word education is from the "education comes from the root "mean" that it means -- to bring out of the potential.
So again, what is the potential that we want to pull out it?
There was a case studio in the 1960 in the 1960 in Grand short schools.
It's called the "evidencevid," we call it the "alinely" here in the United States.
It means separate students dependent on their voices.
And students with the best voices have a smaller program, and they did it for a three months, and they did it for a three-months, and students with the officer officer they said they were good at all.
And at the end of this period of three months, were having a results at the level of the optime-E, clearly, the trister of this studio, and they took students of this student student from the three months. And this is what happened at the end of the three months.
The ones that I had left to school.
The critical part of this study was that even the teachers were winging.
The teachers didn't know that it was done this change.
She was simply saying: These are optime: These are the insufficient.
And so it's how they started teaching them.
So I believe that the real disability is to have a damage, and a damage, and a damaged no hope.
You can't see beauty.
It has no longer our natural children, and our innate ability to imagine.
if you aging, we can support the human spirit to keep the hope, to see the beauty in order to see the beauty in order to be imaginative and curious curious, then we're using our strength correctly.
When the spirit has these quality, we can create new realities and new ways of it.
I want to leave you with a poetry written from a 1300 called Hafiz in the 1,300 called Hafiz Jacques Dembo:
and the poem is called "NO, the God that knows only four parole," "Every child -- not the God of NO, the God of NO, but the God that only knows you just know four words and continued to me."
Thank you.
