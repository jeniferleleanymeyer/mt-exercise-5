Sinchallenge ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
Grups of four people have to build the highest possibly possibly as you can build the highest alone, by using 20 spaghects, a feet of spagheter and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow must be wallowed to the top to the top of the tower to the top of the top of the top of the top to the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top to the top of the top to the top of the top to the top to the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top
And, even though it looks very simple, it's pretty difficult, because the people to collaborate very quickly.
So I thought it was an interesting idea, and I incorporated it in a laboratory.
And it was a huge success.
And since then, I organized about 70 laborators of these kinds of these kinds of these kinds of the world with students, designers and architects, even research and development companies Fortune 50.
There's something in this exercise that reveals the lessons about the nature of collaboration, and I'd like to share some of these lessons with you.
Normal, most of the people are starting with the original compit to the compiece of it.
They talk about that, they can imagine expect might be expect for the power, then they go through the planning.
They do squarters and preavavails and preavavails.
They're going to take the greatest part of the time is assembling the spaghi in buildings, at the end of the time is going to fall, somebody out the marshmallow, and falling it in the top and fall, make a step back and fall.
They're handing the job.
But what happens is really, most of the times of times is that the "Ta-da-to-to-to-hmallow -- because the sea weight of the sea weight of the sea structure.
There is a number of people that have a lot more moments "uh-oh-o-h-to-ol business school.
But, they walked away away and they create absolutely transballing structure.
And there are of course groups that have many more structure," and in the best of the childhood schools of childhood.
And it's amazing.
It says Peter, not only create the highest structures, but they're also the most interesting structures.
And your question is going to be able? What are you possible? What do they have to particular?
And Peter love saying, "No of the kids spend time trying to become the director of SpA." Right.
They don't spend time competing for the power.
But there's another reason.
And the reason is that economy students are formed to find the single best project.
And then you get it.
And then what happens is that when they put the marshmallow at the top, they don't have longer time and what happen?
The crisis.
Does you familiar? Right.
What children do differently, is that they start from the marshmallow, and build prototypes, one after each other, and they have always different possibilities to add prototypes to address prototypes.
The designers recognize that these kinds of collaboration is the essence of the process.
And with every version, children have a feedback of what works and what it doesn't work.
So the ability to work on prototypes, it's essential, but we see how different different working groups.
The average for most of people is about 50 centries, for economy, about 50 centries, for economy, about half of economy, about half, but not much.
Who does better than all?
Architects and engineers, thank you at the sky.
99 percent is the highest structure that I ever seen.
And why? Because they understand that triangles and the triangles and the models and the models are the key to build stable.
And then we have the general directors, a little better than the media.
But that's where it becomes interesting.
If you include a delegated amount of the delegation can do a lot better.
This is incredible. It goes to be a little bit of the backstick at the group will win antic. And why?
Because they have particular abilities in agevolving ability.
They exist the process, I understand it.
And all the groups who gestures and pray attention to the work of the team.
Special and dots of agevolutation, and their combination to a success.
If you have 10 groups who usually well, you'll get structures that are going to get structures that are in the feet.
And I tried an interesting.
I thought, you know, we get the wall.
I put on the 10,000 dollars in software.
What do you think that happened to design?
What was the result of it?
Here's what happened.
None of the team has created a stable structure.
If one of them had built a 2.5 house structure -- it would brought home the prize.
Is it not interesting that a little bit of an impact?
We've tried to the new exercise with the same students.
What do you think is happened?
Now they had the value of a prototype.
The same team, from the worst has become the best.
They created the highest structure in the minute time.
So I'm importantly importantly about the nature of the incentives and the success. You know, why someone should spend time to write a marshmallow?
The reason is this: help create digital instruments and processes to help groups build automous video games.
And what makes a marshmallow is to help identify to identify supposed to identify supposed.
Because, honestly, every project has his marshmallow, is not like that?
The challenge provides a shared experience, a common language, a common position to build a prototype.
And so, this is the value of experience, of this simple exercise.
And those of you were interested in the marshmallowchallenge.com.
It's a blog where you can give a look at how marshmallow.
There are passes for step.
There are examples from all around the world about how people correct and examples the system.
There's also the record in the world.
And the most important, I think, is that design is really a sports of contact sport sport sport sport sports --
It turns out of all the sense of all the senses, and the reasonments and the manuality and manuality to manage the challenge that you have in a hand.
And sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that is necessary to transform a "uh-h-o-h-o-h.
And that can actually make a difference.
Thank you very much.
We ended up having a machine, beautiful, beautiful, in TEDstyle style of TED, it's a time.
Everybody in this room have to go there.
You can go back, you can go back, you can't stay where you are.
And I would be curious to know what to choose is, because I asked my friends in the last few times, and everybody wants to go back.
I don't know. They don't want to go back to the cars or Twitter, or "American Idol."
I don't know.
I'm convinced that there is a kind of returns to our algies, illusions.
I understand.
But I don't do part of that group, I have to admit it.
I don't want to go back, and because I don't want to go back, is because the possibility on this planet doesn't go back, go away.
So I want to go into the car and I want to go on.
This is the best time that there was on this planet in every field that we can measure, healthy, health care of disease.
There was never a period like this.
My needs grandmother, everybody before 60 years.
My grandparents spent that 70.
My parents are to touching 80s.
So it's better that there is a nine at the beginning of my years at my death.
But it's not just about people like us, it's a much bigger than this.
A child born in New Delhi today can be expect to live as much the richest man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it. It's an amazing.
How would it be true?
Vaiolo. The smallpox billions of people on this planet.
She has changed the demography of the globe, as no war has ever done.
If you went to Svanite.
We disconfited.
In the rich world diseases that threatened millions of people just have no longer in practice.
Sifterite, rosolia, poly---
somebody knows what are it?
Vaccine, modern medicine, our skills of feeding billions of people, these are triumps of scientific method.
And second me, the scientific method -- to try things, and see things, if they don't work, is one of the great results of humanity.
These were the good news.
Unfortunately, they were the good news because there are other problems, and have been quoted a lot of times of times, one of them is that, although everything we've got to get -- a billion people goes to read the fact that every day.
This is growing is growing with amazing, and it's vergognow.
And not only we use our creativity to refill the planet.
It takes a small, groundable lands, oil rainforests, oil forests, oil -- they're disappearing and they're disappearing and if we don't innotice our actions to pull us out of this guair to get us out of this drive.
So the question is, we can we do that? I think yes.
I think it's clear that it's possible to make food to feed billions of people without violent the earth that they live in.
I think it's possible to reform this world without that this energy world.
I think I really, and no, it's not a illusion.
But here's the thing I wake up with the night -- one of the things that keep me out of the night.
We've never had to be scientific progress as we need now; we have never been in the position of how we could use them today.
We're at an amazing events -- in many ambites.
But despite this, I think we should go back centuries, 300 years, first of the Illuminism, to find a period in which we fight the progress, a period in which we have the more vigorous face than we have.
People introduce what you believe, and they do it with a lot of force we can't get it.
It turns out the truth of the truth.
You know, everybody has right now. They everyone has right to their opinion; they also have right to the progress, but you know what you haven't you right?
You have no right to your faces. I sorry, you can't.
I put it a little bit about it.
A decade of years ago, I wrote a story about vaccines for "The New Yorker," a short article.
And I was amazing someone opposed to what it is, after all, the most effectively effective of all the most effective than all of the human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I wrote the story, and I wrote the story, and I wrote the story.
Not much later, I wrote a story about genetically food --
Same thing, only bigger.
People were crazy.
So I wrote a story about that, and I couldn't figure out why people were considered OGM as "most," because they thought they would move the molecules in a specific way, instead of the molecules in a house, instead of the work of nature.
But, I wrote my job. I wrote the story and went on.
I mean, I'm a journalist: we send, sends up there.
But these stories came back and I couldn't understand why, but at the end I did.
The problem was that those fanatics who were doing not fanated.
They were consciousness, educated, people for well.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And that was a lot of --
But then I thought, we have to be honest; we're at a point, on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship with progress.
We're going to talk to the environment.
We're talking about ironic using the ironic virgolet: "Progres." Oh, well, there are reasons to do that, and I think we know what they are.
We've lost trust in institutions, in authority, and sometimes in science itself, and it's understandable that has happened.
You just do some names and people understand it.
Chernobnobn's Bhopal, the Challenger, Viox, Viox, exceptual elections.
I mean, each one has his list.
We have questions and problems with people that we were thinking about it.
So you're skeptical.
Let's asking answers, you pretend answers to it.
You don't give anything for granted.
But here's the foundation: when the evidence is necessary to accept them, and we're not very good at this.
And I think that the reason is that we have in an epidemic of fear that I had never seen and hope I never saw and I hope I can't see it.
About 12 years ago, a story, orrible story, a horrible story that supported there was a bond of autism and the house vaccines, paroted and rosolia.
Very scary.
Hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true.
And they had to do hundreds of study; it's a important.
They came up with the data.
They came from the United States, from the U.S., from the Sweden, from Canada, and everyone were equal, no correlationship, no correlationship, no correlationship, no correlationship,
It doesn't make a difference. It didn't make it because we believe the aneddoes, to what we see -- to what we see -- to what we think we can see, what it makes us feel real.
We don't believe a pile of document documents of the government that are showing us numbers, and we understand it everybody.
But you know what?
The results have been to --
because this is a fact: the U.S., is one of the few countries in the world in which the number of vaccines against death.
It's horrible, and we should be true.
It's awful.
What happened that happened that he puts us to do something like that?
Now, I understand. I understand it.
Think about it, someone here has the morning?
Somebody in the audience has ever seen a person die of death?
It doesn't happen.
In this country doesn't happen, but this happened 160,000 times in the world last year.
I'm a lot of deaths for death; 20 every hour.
But as Jenny successful here, we can take it from your head, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around to shoot messages of fear and ignorance messages like Oprah Larry King Live.
And they can do because they don't understand the difference between causality and correlationship.
They don't understand that these two things seem equals, but they're not almost mayor.
But it's something that we have to learn, and we have to learn it quickly.
This man was a hero, Jonas Salk.
She has liberated the humanity from one of his flowers.
No suffering, no suffering -- the polyo, puff.
The man at the middle in the middle.
It's called Paul Offit.
She just created a vaccine against the rotable together.
He saved 400, life of 400,000 children every year in the developing countries.
Is it bad, right?
It's good, if it wasn't that Paul goes around to talk about vaccines, says how precious and people should just stop friends.
And it says in these terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul talks to a public evidence can't test testimony without an arma.
They call it at home because of some pleasy to remember him where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul has created a vaccine.
I wouldn't need to tell you, but vaccines are fundamental.
If we stop taking them, the disease, disease back, terrible disease, and it's going on.
We have the new death in this country.
And it's going to be worse, and between not very much children will begin to die again, because it's just a lot of numbers.
And they wouldn't diy death.
Are the policy? Are that one. Why not?
One of my college of college wrote me a couple of weeks ago, and told me that it was considered a little bit excessively.
Nobody had told me before.
She wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't be won the polyo.
All right.
OK.
Why? Because there is no polio from us. But you know what?
We didn't have the polio in the United States.
I don't know. I -- maybe it's a guy of a guy is saliped on a plane in Lagos Angeles, now is coming to L.A.
Maybe it will land in a couple of hours, will notice a machine, it will be here in Long Beach and stasera of these fantastic cenvironmental cenvironed by the TED.
He doesn't know that to be infected by a paralyzed disease, and we don't know because it's so that it works the world.
This is the planet that we live in. We don't do that it's not like this.
We're going to address. We're going to do it.
All of you have tains stay?
Echinacea, a bit of antiossidants to start the day.
I know you did it because Americans of Americans do it every day.
They take that stuff, as they cut up at the alternative medicine, and not matter how often we are unuseful.
The data demonstrate seeds.
They get the best urine. More of this doesn't do anywhere.
But it's good, you want to spend 28 billion dollars for school, are with you!
Urine school. Stail.
Why?
I think we can understand, we know.
We have the great government machine. We don't figure it.
And we do good. Our health care schif.
It's cruel to millions of people.
It's absolutely incredibly cold, and demoralizing for those of us that can afford it.
So we get far away away from who?
We're going to be in the great placebo.
It's great. We love the great placebo.
You know, it's a serious problem because this stuff is a schip, and we spend billion dollars.
I have a whole series of examples.
No one of these -- a frog -- a from, echinacea -- I don't even know what it is but we spend billions of dollars, and it's a from.
You know what? When I say these things, you know, people read to me.
It makes them well."
Do you guess what? Do you walk back.
Because I don't care about if it's the secretary of the Department for Salute and Servizi Umani Umani to say, "Uhm, I don't have to hear the evidence of the mographic, or if it says it says the patients of patients.
When we put the street that leads to replace science and evidence and evidence with magic and tradition, we end up in a place where we wouldn't be.
We start like Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
She killed 400 measures continuing to say that boats, babole, cut and cross and bouncked better than the ancial drugs that we know can slow the decord.
Hundreds of thousand thousands of deaths in a country that has been slower than every other one from this disease.
Please, you don't get to tell me that there are no consequences.
There are seeds. There are seeing.
Now, the largest epidemic epidemic right now is the war in the middle of the genetics of genetically modified and the elite of the biological food.
It's an idiatriba. It must end up there.
It's a diatriba, on the metaphors.
It's ideology, it's not science.
Every single thing we eat, every chick of rise, every chick of price Bruxelles was modified by the man.
See, there weren't sending in the Eden.
There were no money.
There were no Natal trees.
We've done it in the last 1111-year-old.
Something worked and something else.
And we eliminated what it doesn't work.
Now we can do it more precise.
And there are risks, of course we are.
But we can insert things like vitamine, and this would help millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people --
And we don't want to do it?
I have to tell you, I don't understand.
We're against OGM.
Why?
The things that I hear them: we too many chemicides, pesticides, hormonoculture, we don't want to change with the same thing, it's wrong.
We don't want that the companies to patents on life.
We don't want that the companies are uniques.
You know what my answer to this?
That's right. We're right. Let's do something.
It's true, we have a huge food problem, but it's not science.
It has nothing to do with science.
It's laws, morality line drives on shorts.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes gives you a positive result, but the idea that we shouldn't afford to do his science to do because we have afraid to prosper.
You know, in the next 50 years we're going to be cost-cost to produce 70 percent of what we produce now.
These are the investments in Africa of the last 30 years.
Vergo.
They need us and don't need them to diam.
Why? Cibo genetically.
We don't want to encourage people to eat squarters like manioca.
Back billion people eat.
It looks a little bit like a little bit.
But it turns out just calories.
It doesn't have no nutrients, it doesn't have proteins, but scientists are finding the way of snutrients right now.
So a lot of people could eat less and run the risk of becoming sky.
They wouldn't die and you know what?
It would be very beautiful. It would not be a restaurant, but it would be very beautiful.
I was going to wonder: Why are we counter?
I mean, do we call this thing?
Only why don't we want to move the genes and there?
It's about genes.
It's not about our holding obsession for the hours, or of our bigger food.
They don't get the Rice Krispies.
This is about saving people, and it would be that we begin to understand what it means to say.
Why do you want to know? -- if we don't understand, and we keep behavior, we are going to be a lot of something that we don't think we want to be something that we don't think we want to argue it, colonialism.
There's no other way to describe what is going on.
It's egoist, it's horrible, it's horrible, and we have to stop it.
So, after this funny conversation of fun, you might say, "You still want to ask myself, "You still want to go into this ridiculous time and go to the future?"
Okay, of course.
It's stuck on the present now, but we have an amazing opportunity.
We can impose the machine of time as we want.
We have a chance to go where we want, and we're going to get where we want.
We have to do these conversations, and we have to think, but when we go into the machine, and we're going to be happy to do it.
I know that we can -- I think that the world needs.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the chronist of the Los Angeles Times Steve Lopez was passewing for the streets of Los Angeles when he wrote a beautiful music.
It was from a man -- a man Afro-American-American-American-American, fascinating, with the march, without dead, who was a violin that he had only two crows.
I'm telling a story that a lot of you know -- because the Steve articles of Steve Look in a book, which, in the followed to the great screen, with Robert Downew, with Robert Downeed, with Robert Lopez, and Jamie Fox, and Jamie Foxie in Nathony Ayers, the contrabts of the schief of the schief that was international by the schievement of the schief of the schief of which was inter.
Nathaniel lass like Juilliard, he had a terrible nervous, and 30 years later lived as a without toughly on the streets of Skid Row in the middle of Los Angeles.
I mean all of you to read the Steve book to look at the film to look at the film to understand not just the beautiful tie that created between these two men,
I call Jane McGonigal. They're a video games.
I realize games from 10 years and my objective online for the next 10 years, is to try to save the world in real life.
To make it a plan, and it convincing more people, I understood all of you, to spend more beautiful games.
We have three billion hours to play a week playing online.
Some of you might think, "It's a lot of time spent to play it."
maybe too time, considering how many of the urgent problems we have to solve in the real world.
In fact, second my research research that I took the Istitute for Futuro, actually is the contrary.
Three billions of hours are not minimally enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world.
In fact, I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we have to increase that digneeds to increase that dig.
I calculated that the total that we need is 21 billion hours of play every week.
This is probably an idea a controintuitive, so the repet, so the repet, to reinforces the concept.
If we want to solve problems that fame, poverty, the climate change, the global conflict, global conflict, the obesity, I believe we have to have the environmental online, for at least 21 billion hours of the next decadecade. No, are serious.
This is why. This picture is because I think that it's so important to play is so important for the survival of the human species.
This is a portrait of the photographer Phil Toldan, he wanted to capture the emotion.
So he photographed some of the players while they players players.
And this is an emotional classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classick.
If you're not used to be players that you losed some of this picture.
You probably notice the sense of urgence, a little bit of fear, but also a very profound concentration, a very deep attention to face a very difficult problem.
If you are used to notical players, you notice around the eyes, and around the eyes, and around the mouth are a sign of optimism.
And it turns them to get surprise.
This is a habital player to a step from one thing called "Epicaw."
Ah, it's a term that you've heard. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
So we have habital players between us.
A victory is a result so extraordinarily positive that doesn't seem to you can.
It's almost beyond the leap of the imagination, and when you get a shock discovering what you're really skill.
This player is at a epical player is a epical player.
And this is the expression we need to see on the fact that we need to see about millions of problems in the world as we face the obstacles of someone which, against all the expression of someone which, against all the expression of someone which, against all the expectations,
Unfortunately, this is the expression that we see in the life of all the day-while we face to deal problems.
This is the expression that I call "Brate Nella Realty. And I'm going to do it.
I am with the expression, "I'm not Bry."
This is a grafferent in my old Berkeley, in California, where I did the PhD in California, where I did PhD in the real life.
And this is a lot of a lot of people players: we feel that we are not good as good as in games.
And I don't mean simply like success -- even though the successful one of the success is going to get more results in online.
But I mean, "good good at the sense of motivates to do something important, inspired to collaborate and cooperating.
And when we're in an online world, I believe that many of us become the best versions of themselves to help without pretty prevantagain and more capable of concentrate on a problem for the entire time, to get up after a failure and try new new.
And in the real life, when we face a failure, when we face a obstacle, we often not feel like that we feel like that we feel anxious, maybe depressed, maybe depressed or Chinic.
We never provide these feelings as a game, simply doesn't exist in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study to university.
What is in a game is that in a game that we can't get any result?
How can we transport those feelings and applying them into the real?
So I studied a games like World of Warcraft, which is really the ideal environment to solve problems.
And I started to notice some things that make the epic lives so possible in online.
The first is, when you open up in one of these games online, especially in World of Warcraft, there are lots of different characters that flower to save the points to save the world.
But not a mission mission: a perfectly mission, perfectly adegue in the game. Right?
So you can complete.
They're not going to give you impossible.
But it's at the limite of your skills. So you have to try seriously.
But there is no disoccupation in World of Warcraft, you don't spend time to turn the pollens, there's always something specific and important to do.
And there are many collaborators.
All right, hundreds of thousands of people, ready to join your epical mission.
This is not something so common in real life, this feeling that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there is this narrative epic, this narratives that inspire is there, and what we're doing.
And then we remember this positive feedback positive --
You've heard about increasing level and forces -- one intelligence.
We don't receive that kind of constants in real life.
When I leave this stage is not going to have a public talking about front of a audience.
I didn't get that kind of feedback in real life.
Now, the problem of collaborative online like World of Warcraft is that gives so much satisfaction is that it gives to a step from a living life, which we decide to spend all our time in these games.
It's just better than reality.
This is for that, end, collectively all of the World Warcraft have spent 5.93 million years to solve the virtual problems.
This is not necessarily.
But put it in perspective: 5.93 million years ago was the time in which one of our ancestors.
That was the first time walking walking her.
Okay, so when we talk about what we're investing in the play, the only manier-sensory of thinking about them, is to talk about the human evolution of human evolution, which is also useful, but also useful, because we discovered that we're changing all of this time to play, we're changing what we're changing what we're going to have more heart and more heart.
This is true, I believe.
So you know this statistics.
It was published recently by a Carnagie Mellon.
The typical young medium today in a country in a country with a stronger of a country to do 10,000 hours playing online, at the age of 21 years.
10,000 hours is an interesting number of two reasons.
First of all, for the children in the United States, 10.080 hours is the exacact number of hours to school maturity if you're present every day.
So we have a whole whole parallel of education in which young people learn how to be the player to school players' players.
And some of you will have probably read the new of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuoriclasse."
If you've got a read of successful theory of successful, the 10,000 hours for success.
It's based on a good research in the cognition, that if we detect 10,000 hours of study fruitous phruttuous at the age of 21 years of genes in that field.
We're going to be good at something as much the best people in the world.
So what we have now now now is a whole generation of young people.
So the question is: "Exactly, what become bad these playing?"
because if we could figure out what we're going to have a amount of human resources of human resources.
This is the number of people in the world that are at least one day to play online.
These are our genets.
500 million people who are extraordinary -- in something.
And in the next decade we have another billion of habital players that are extraordinary.
If you didn't know it, this is what it expected -- the video game industry is developing platforms that consumed power than consuming power and work with the cell phone that will work with the Internet in India, China, Brazil players around the world, in India, China, Brazil, China, Brazil can connect online.
The estimate is a billion players in the next decade.
This is going to take us 1.5 billion players.
So I started thinking under what these games are transforming into genes.
These are four expects that I have individuals. The first is a very good urgent.
Okay. Think it as a extreme of self-motivation.
A optimism is the desire to immediately actly to deal with a obstacle, together with the convinction of having a reasonable reasonable to have a reasonable of success.
The abitual players believe that a victory is possible and it is possible and that it always has the pends of trying to make it now.
The habital players are not with the hands.
Ahabital players are virtuous virtuous with a social trame.
There are a lot of interesting research that show how we find better with other people after played with them, even though they were playing with them, even though they had been playing with other people.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of furns to play with someone -- we trusted that they are going to do with the same rules and with the same rules and obbirds and obbirds to the conclusion of the game.
So, to play together, build the bonds of the cooperation and cooperation of cooperation and cooperation.
We really have a result we really have a lot more robust.
Just a joy productivity.
You know, there's a reason why the World Warcraft player 22 hours a week player 22 hours a week, almost as a part-to-time.
It's because we know, while we're playing -- that we actually play, rather happy worked him, or losing time.
We know that we are optimized, as a human, as a human beings, to work anything that has meaned.
And used to do habital players are dispoundly, if it's a adapt task if it's an adaptancy.
Finally, an epic means.
The habitual players to be associated with wonderful missions and human-scale history.
For example, a little information to help create a context.
You know Wikipedia, the biggest wiki in the world.
The second wiki biggest wiki in the world, with almost 80,000 articles is World of Warcraft China.
They have skilled more information on World of Warcraft in the Internet, whatever wiki in any other wiki in any other wiki in the world.
They're building an epicture.
They're building a source of information source in World Warcraft.
Okay, these are the four superpowers that together.
Ahabital players are individuals of great optimism of super-powers.
These are people who believe being individually skills to change the world.
The only problem is that believed to be able to change the virtual worlds but not real.
This is the problem I'm trying to solve.
There's a economy of Edward Castronova.
Her studies are brilliant. She's studying reason why people invested so much time, energy and money, in online.
He says, "We're looking at what it costs nothing less than a mass exhibition to the virtual worlds and the environments.
And it's a cheaper, so it's rational and says -- I am not like me, I'm a player project --
But he says -- he says this is a perfectly sensory, because used players can get more in the online of online in the world that in real life.
They can have more solid social relationships in a game that not in real life.
They have a better feedback and feel more feeling feeling more reward in a game that not in real life.
So, I mean, it's perfectly reasonable players for habital players in the real world that in the real world that in the real world that this is reasonable to agree that this is reason for now but it's not, in a way, a situation of ideal game. We have to begin to make the world more like a game.
Here's a tragging from something that happened 2500 years ago.
These are along ancients, facts of host of Prima to have a joysticks and butting wonderful challenge of sheep. And these are the first instruments of humanity.
If you know the ancient of the ancient historical written history.
It's the story of who invented games and why.
And I was born that plays, particularly the games of the game of the Lidia, during a period of the Lidia, during a period of caresty.
It turns out that in the Lidia decided to do something impensible.
People suffering, the population was at the end of the extreme -- they need an extrema.
So, second Erodot, they invented the game of days and emanded a valid laws for all over the rule.
One day, everybody would have eated.
The next day everybody would have played.
And they diving so profoundly in the game of the playing is so involved in a joyed state of a joy-productivity, that they ignored the fact that they have nothing to eat.
And so one day they play, and a day they eat a day.
And second Erodot, they went so 18 years old, survive to eat a day and playing the follow.
I think that's exactly the way we use today.
We use games to get to sleep on the real world.
We use games to get away from everything that doesn't work in our real environment, from everything that doesn't work in our real life, and get what we need from the games.
But we don't need to stop here.
This is really interesting: second Erodot, in 18 years, the paper, so the caresty decided that they would played a last wall.
They became up with the whole realm in the middle, and they played a game parts of that participate into the epic adventure.
They let up the Lidia and they went to look at a new earth where to live, leaving the number of people to survive with the resources of people to survive with the resources of their civilization somewhere, where else you could have their civilization somewhere, where you could prosper.
It's a little idea idea, right?
But it turns out of the DNA has revealed that the Etrusers that would have brought to the roman, shared the same DNA of the Lidia.
So the recently scientists have suggested that the story of Erodote is a real story.
And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that almost 20 years and that might explain the caresty.
So this amazing story might be true: they could have saved their culture playing, refugee in the game for 18 years to be so inspire as well as well as well as well as I met to save that the whole civilization.
Okay, we can do it.
We're at World of Warcraft from 1994.
It was the first game of strategy in real time of the World Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
They played by 18 years, we played Warcraft for 16 years.
I say, we're ready for our epic go.
They would work out half the population of the population of a new world.
This is where I tragge the idea of 21 billion hours of play a week.
We do half that half of us agreement to go through a day to play a day to play the problems of the real world.
Imagine what you're going to ask, "How do we solve the problems of the real world in a game?" Well, this is what I've dedicated to my work on the last years, I have the Istitute for Futuro.
In our own Palo Alto we have this stendaries our idea of how we should relate to our idea of how we should relate to the future.
We don't want to predict the future.
What we want to do is -- the future.
We want to imagine the scenaries from the best results and then we want to give the possibility to transform them in reality.
We want to imagine lives to make epic epic epic to make them.
I'm going to show you three games I realized games that I realized and I'm a attempt to create of the epic lives in their future.
This is "Mondwell."
We did this game in 2007.
It's a online online in which you seeks to survive to a card oil.
It's not real, but we published, but we published sufficient online to make life as well as if we were at the side, and to make life like if we were at the secket -- you know, when you go into the play -- and you have news that area of you, and dopoints that show exactly the cost of the oil things that are not available, the impact of food distribution of the distribution.
The impact on transportation, if the schools are closed, and you have to think about how you living your life. And you have to think about how you would do your life if that was real. And you have a blog on a blog on the video --
We had this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we looked at them for the three years, and what I can say is that transform.
No one wants to change the maniera in which lives because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world.
But if you dive them in an epic adventure and says, "We've got no longer oil.
This is an amazing! A adventure to what you can participattern.
It suntil you see how to survive it."
Most of our players who learned in the players that learned in the game.
So, for the next to save the world, we decided to save the world, we decided to put higher more than oil than oil.
We did a game called Superperstruct, at the Istitute for Futuro, and the premise was, a supercomputer computed that humanity has only other 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputer was called "The Global of Allerte Estination of the Global Estination.
We've asked people to reach online almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer's movie.
You know Jerry Bruckheimer's films of a dream, machiner's films -- there is astronauta, scientist, the scientist, and everybody else to save the world, but in our game, but in our game, instead of haven't got five people in the team, and the future of the energy, the future of the energy, the future of resource and the future.
8,000 people played for eight weeks to eight weeks, incredibly creative solutions that you can find if you go online and look for Google "Supercle."
Finally, the last game, the three of marze. This is a three of marze. This is a Mondial Bank.
If I complete the game is going to be certified by the Istitute of the World Bank, like the Social Innovator class of 2010.
Woring with the universities of sub-Saharan Africa, we're inviting them to learn the social techniques.
There is a story in comics, you increase level of levels like the local knowledge, sustainability, the imagination.
Two inviting all of you to share this young with young people, wherever in the world, particularly in the developing areas of the development, which may be benefit from the ones of the world to save the world to save the world.
It's now to conclusion.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think what happen?
We have all of these amazing players. We have these games that are projects of what we could do is, but no one of these has still saved the real world.
Well, I hope that you agree with me that I agresource that we can use to make a human resource that we can use to do the real world that games are a powerful platform for change, that we have these incredible superpowerful superpowerful productivity that we have these incredible superpowerful resources of a epic meaning.
And I really hope that we can be met to play players that are important, to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that you join me in the realize and participatterns like this.
When I look at the next decade, two things are certainly, two things are certain -- that we can do any future, and that we can play anywhere we want to play anywhere we want.
So, I mean, let's take the games that will change the world.
Thank you.
For some time I was interested in placebo effect, it can seem like a magician effect of it, unless you consider that you don't look at the point of view is a reality thing is believed to become something realong to become something reality in some studies, the sugar effect in some studies effect in some studies, the fact because the person thinks
which is happening is to have to be a drug or something like --
The sweet of the pain, for example, if they believe you have a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect.
Something is true for perception that if you have.
To figure that I want to show you a magic trick very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that is present in all the books.
I learned from only with Cub Sco-Magic Scout Magic in the 19setting.
And so I'm going to extend to you and explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I explained.
This is what happens.
The color, that you can examinate; my hand, you can examine.
I'm just going to turn the slides in my pug, like this.
I was up on the hand.
To be safe to be saving from my hand.
Now weird my poly-like this.
So you can see that something that you ever see something that can go on or down to my hand.
And the purpose of that is simple.
I go to open up my hand, and if everything has gone good, my magnetism is going to open the cola.
In fact, it remains that I can school that I can school, and the color doesn't fall.
Nothing goes on or out of my hand.
There's no trick. You can examine anything.
Ta-da!
This is a trick that often check to the children.
that are interested in the magic because you can learn a lot about the ingage of the ingage of the ingage of this is very simple.
Many of you in this room will know this trick.
Here's what happens I Tengo to my hand.
I say that I saw my wright.
to make sure that cloud or saving out of my hand, this is a good thing.
The reason I keep the pole is because it's the secret of illusion.
In the moment when my hand moves away from you, this fingtandoses here, my indeed here, my indeed, he shoulder, in a position.
There's somebody who didn't have a childhood.
This is from there, right.
And when I turn the finger is moving.
We can talk about why it's ingannel, because you don't notice that there are only three fingers down because the mind, and the way with which information doesn't contain, one, two, three.
But that's not the point. Right? And when I open my hand, Obviously stayed not through the animal magnetism,
And when I close my finger, same thing, when I walk back, this movement to go back.
You know, the hand. The hand.
It's a trick you can do with your friends and close. Thank you.
Now, what has to do with the placebo?
I read a study, a year ago, a year ago, a year ago.
I'm not a medical researcher, for which was a surprising.
It looks like that if you look at a placebo in the form of a white pill of a white pilly aspill, just a white pill. It has a measurable.
But if you change the shape and you give the placebo, in the form of a smaller pill, and blue printed a literally more effective.
Even though none of the two has no drug sugar.
But a white pill, the white pill.
What? She really wall.
But by the way, it's not the end of it.
The capsules are more effective than every form.
A capsule of the colored one hair, which is a resist of a capsule.
The dosage has a roly.
A couple two times a day is not as effective like three pills. Now I don't remember the statistics.
But the point is,
-- that these dosages have a roly.
And it also has a roless.
And if you want to use a definitive you have to use a ago.
Right? A siringe with something -- a couple of ces.
You start it in a patient --
This is a strong image so strong in their mind, much stronger than the white pill.
It's real, this graphics -- I'm going to show you another time when we have slides.
The point is that the white pillle is not effective like that blue is not as effective as a ago.
And no one of these has a drug quality.
It's just your believing that makes them in your cover and raphforce the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and applying it to a magic trick.
And do something that is a trick and make it seem real.
And we know from the study that when you want to use the ago.
This is a seven inchicks, Molicenpoint.
The sterilist a while.
This is my meat. This is not a special Cark.
This is my skin. This is not a special hollywood.
I'm going to bucket my skins and to go this ago to the oppoint.
If you tried nauseful -- if you get easily -- I did for a few friends in the trego, the other night, and for some of the woman is almost like this.
So if you try nauseful easy, I suggest that you don't look for the next 30s -- in fact, I'm going to do the first bad part here.
You can see, you can see, you can see from another part.
Here's what happens, the beginning of my arm at the bottom of my arm, I just do a little bull.
Do you use it?
And now a little through my skin, and out the other hand, like this.
Now, we're in the same position.
More or now? But you can't count my fingers now?
So you have the most. Here two three, four, five --
I know what people looks like when you see that.
They think, "Sically, it's not going to be stupid bucket just to different skins for a few minutes."
So, let you let me give you a swall.
Are you going to be good.
Yeah, I know that there are behind "Okay, I don't saw it well."
People in the rooms are wrong.
Let me show you close.
This is really my skin. It's not a special effect of Hollywood.
This is my carne, and I can turn it around it.
Sorry, if you feel bad you look at another part, you don't look at it.
People in the bottom or going to look between a few years, "Well, it's clear that it was clear, but if it was true --
You can see a hole here and a hole here, if it was true blood here, if it was true blood --
Well, now I get out a little blood for you.
Here's here.
Normally now she would leave the ago.
I would like my arm, and I would like to see that there are not hurted.
But I believe that in this context and the idea of taking something fake and turn it into something true, I'll let it should be -- and I'm going to go from the stage.
We're going to see different in the next day. I hope you can't see the right now. Thank you very much.
So, in my life, I met a lot of fish.
I just loved it only two.
The first one of a passional story.
It was a beautiful fish beautiful fish, one of the best.
What a fish!
But even better than a better farming farmed standard of the sandard standards of the environmental standard.
So, you hear with consciousness to sell.
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for different months.
A day, the head of the company called me and asked me to talk about a dedicated event of the environmental sustainability of training.
"Of course I said,
This was a company that he was trying to solve what it was a unimaginable problem for our chef.
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu?
During the last 50 years we have weighed in the same way we have sentence.
The destruction has been tremendous.
90 percent of the great fish, the ones that we like so the tonn, the halibut, the halibut, the heavens are reduced by number of number.
There is almost nothing about it.
So, we like to do or less water or less water of the fish, it will become part of our future.
There are a lot of arguments.
The crawings of the fish, for the least most of themselves, and they're inefficient. You take the ton for example.
A great problem is that there is a food food of 15 to one.
This means that it means that it takes 15 swild fish to get a book.
It's not very sustainable.
And the knows is not a great challenge.
So here's here here was a company that was trying to do it in the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The first one of the event I telephone cap of the public audiences.
Let's call it Don.
"Don," I said, "How much to understand, you know, you are famous to do so far away in the away that you don't pollut."
"Exact," he said, "We're so far away from our shot that our scarts are diluits, not concentration."
And then add "We're basically a world in particular world.
"The rate of conversions? 2.5 to a hand."
"The best in sector."
2.5 to one, fantastic.
"2.5 to something? What do you eat to fish?"
"The sustainable protein say.
"Great," I said, "Look yell.
The night, I was at night, I thought, I thought, but it's a sustainable protein it?
So the next day after the event, I called Don.
I said, "Don, do you have some examples of sustainable protein s?"
He said that I didn't know it, and he would be asked around around here.
Well, I talked to a little bit about the company, and no one to give me an answer.
And until I talk to the biologist.
We put him Don.
"Don," I said, "Do you have some examples of sustainable protein s?"
Well, he mentioned a few algalg algae and then said, "Pollollo."
I said, "People of pollod?"
He said, "Yeah, though, sand bong, sleep, sliced and processed to eat."
I said, "What's the percentage of your eat is made of pollo?"
I think, say, the two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent."
I said, "What's sustainable in giving the chicken of the pollo to the fishing?"
There was a long pauses on telephone and then said, "There are just too chickens.
I sweaving this fish.
No, because I'm not one of those virtuosis of the good food.
Well, to say that truth. I are.
No, in fact, I disamount of this fish because, you know, I want to do it after that conversation, the fish.
The second fish is a different love.
It's a story that is the kind of story for which you know the fish and the most knowledge.
I eat him for the first time in a restaurant, in the south of Spaper.
A friend of my journalist on this fish.
She had done us to met us.
He came to the table had a brilliant white color, almost swimming.
The chef had taken it too much.
Spindouble of how it had to be cotted.
Incredibly, it was still deliver.
Who is able to make a good fish so good after having the street?
I mean, but this guy yes.
Let's call Miguel.
It's actually called Miguel.
No, it didn't have the fish, and it's not a chef.
For lessly, not in the sense that we mean by it.
This is a biologist in Veta. The Palma which is a fish of fish in the corner of the Spain to the Spain to the Spain of the river.
As the '80s, the early 80 the crows.
They had bovens on what before was essentially was a paludox area.
They had given the earth building a series intriced of canals that water in the river.
Well, they couldn't make it works out what not from the economic point of view.
And from the ecologist, it was a disaster.
She had killed something like 90 percent of the birds and looking at the place, it's a lot of birds.
So in 1982 an company with a spagnos with a conscious environmental consciousness,
What do they do?
It turns out of water.
Literally, they invert the switches.
Instead of convolving water from the ground, they use the channels to the channels.
They mean all the channels.
They realized a 27 pounds of fishing out of 27 miles spigs, rangers and in this process, Miguel and this company, Miguel and this company -- the ecologic destruction of the ecologic destruction.
The farming is incredible.
I mean, you never saw a thing like this.
Look at the horizonte that seems to be a million miles and everything that you see are the inones and this recognizes and this recognize.
I've been there little time ago with Miguel.
It's an amazing three quart quarter Charts Darwin and a quarter Crocode Dundee.
Okay? We're made in the middle to this lague, I had the fanger and I had the fanger and Miguel, he had his biology.
First of a white North white.
Then he explain the fitos of the fitoplankton and fish sets that remembers that remember the giraffe of Tanzania.
It turns out out that Miguel has spent a lot of the National Park in Africa.
I asked them how it was becoming a fish.
She said, "You know what? I don't know about fish.
I'm an expert in relationship."
And he sweeps later he still swalks on rare along water.
Don't well, this was very fascinating, which was very fascinating thing, which is like biotic community.
He's interesting, but I was in love with it.
And my head was continuing to thinking about that delious fish.
So interrupts and I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish so good fish so good fish so good fish swit?"
He indicated the algae indicated the algae.
"I know, the algae fitoplankton, the relationships, yes, it's amazing.
But your fish what are they eat?
What's your food conversion of food conversion?
Well, it answers to me how they would be a rich system so rich that the fish eat exactly what they would send in a selfish.
The biomass of the plants, the stoplankton -- that's all of the fish.
The system is so in health that is completely self-innove system.
There are no eat.
Do you ever heard of a farming that doesn't give to their animals?
More later, I was driving around the earth with Miguel and I said, "In a place like this looks like so natural so that it seems so natural that has ever seems to measuring the success?"
At that moment, it was like if the regist of a movie had the change of the set.
And we looked at the corner and we saw a scene between the most incredible thousands and thousands and thousands of phencopters of the slides of eye.
"That's the success," he said, "That's successful.
"Look to their bloods.
They're bank you.
Bancheck? I was completely confuse.
I said, "Miguel, but they're not banching with your fish?"
"Yeah.
"Why we have about 20 percent of the fish and the eggs of the bird.
So last year on this properties there were 600,000 birds over 250 species.
Today has become the biggest and one of the most important healthcare of the biggest biggest birds in the Europa."
I said, "Miguel, but a bird population of bird bird is not the last thing you would like to be in a fish?"
SStail, no.
He said, "We're going to get extensive.
This is an ecological networks.
The phencopters eat the legs.
The legs are eating the fitoplankton.
So it's so much better is the system."
Okay, then we would sname that is not giving to eat his animals and that measures his success in the health.
It's a fish, but also a healthcare for bird.
Ah, at the way, those phenicopter they shouldn't even be.
They make the nests in a 150 miles where the soil conditions of the soil conditions.
Each morning, they flying for 150 miles and get to the flies and get to the 150 miles for the back.
They do it because they're able to follow the white line, white line of the A92.
On the seriously.
I would imagine something like Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, they flying for 150 miles to the farming and then 150 miles of night to go back?
Do they do it for their small?"
He looked at me how if I just quoted a song of Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they do it because food is improve."
I didn't speak about the skins of my loved fish that was deliver, and I usually don't like the skin.
I don't like abbracust, I don't like crossing.
It's that knowledge, like asphalt.
Don't cooking it almost away.
And yet, when I asked it in the south of Spain south of the Spain of the Spainting of the skin.
He had a sweet sweet and cleaned was like giving an ocean.
And I said to Miguel, and he annued.
He said, "The skin is like a spug.
It's the last defense that anything to be in the fish.
It's evolved to hold the impurity."
And then add "But our water has no impurity."
Okay. It's a farming that not his fish.
A farming that measures its predators of its predators.
And then I realized that when he says that he says that the water is not very much the water than the water that fluid in that fluid in that that fluid is a river, which is a river, which is a river, which is a river, which is a rivers that the rivers tends of pesticides.
And when it goes down the system and it goes is clean than when it's good.
The system is so in the healthy, that water.
So, not just a farming that doesn't just soup up its animal that measure his success in the basic health of his success in the health of his predators, but a crafy of water and not just for those fish and not just for those fish and for you.
Because when water water, it goes in the Atlantic.
This is a drop in the ocean, but I know the well, and so you should be able to do because this romantic love of how romantic love is also instructive.
It could say that it's a recipe for the future of good food is that fish is that weighs of bovines.
And what we need is a radically new agriculture of agriculture in which food has really good know.
But for a lot of people, this is a little too radical.
We're not realists, passionate of food.
We're loving.
We put the little agricultural markets.
We put the small familiar farmers.
We talk about local food.
We eat biology.
And when you say that these are the things that make sure the future of good food and says, "Hey, you know, "Hey, you even like the red food and says, "Hey, even to me like you think, but how do you think we could feed the entire world.
How do you think we can feed the world?"
Can I be main?
It's a question I don't like it.
No, because we produce not because we produce enough to feed the world.
A billion people suffering the hunger today.
One billion -- more than we ever -- because of the enormous amount of the enormous amount of the distribution.
See, I don't like this question because he determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years.
From cereals to the pestics to the monocultures, chemicals to the chickens to the fish, and all this period of the agricultural industry has just asked "If we could feed more people, what are we going to do.
This was the motivation.
It was the justified.
It was the business of business of the American agriculture.
We should call it for what it is, an industry that is a liquid industry that is fastly erod-erodd industry that makes a possible.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our panimal today is not because of providence in declines but for the resources in declined not for the last invention for the last invention of chanics, but for the earth of water -- not for the fresh water not for the mocket and not for the fresh of the fresh and not for the weighs in the sea.
Do you want to feed the world?
Let's start asking ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that connect to every local communities to feed?
To do that, we don't look at the model of the future.
It's a model and stank.
And it all over capital, chemistry and machinery, and it never really produced anything good to eat.
We look at the ecological model.
This is what contains about two billion years of the work.
Let's look at Miguel, at allevators like Miguel, and farm that are not closed in if they are not as much as a farmer that rebuild instead of consumption that they have extensively instead that only extensively instead that only instead of that only experts in relationships, because they are the people who are also experts in the knowly.
If I have to be truly chef best chef that I can ever be I.
You know, at me good, because if that is going to be the future of good food, it's going to be deliver.
Thank you.
I grew up with a further base diet of phantom.
At high high school -- I took a school hours and back every day.
And I was always immersed in a book of science book, which was taking my mind in other worlds, and satisfaced in a narrative form, that insatile sense of curious curiosity that I had to.
And that curious curiosity was also in the fact that every time I wasn't at school out in the wood, excursions to hunters, naks, insects and snails, insects and water several and sects and water sections, and I brought them to the microscope.
I was a real geek of science.
But it was always trying to figure the world, understanding the limitations.
And my love for science in reality seemed to respect the world around me, because what was happening in the early 1960s, we were going to go on the moon, we were going to explored the moon, explored the depth of the oceans, Jacques Cousteau was entered in our animals and places that showed us wouldn't have to imagine.
So it seemed to make my passion for science.
And I was an artist.
I knew to draw. I knew painting. I knew painting.
And since there were no video games in the middle of film generated to computer, not all these pictures in the media, I had to create these pictures in my head.
From a children, when we read a book, we all had to put something on the screen on the screen of our tests.
And so, my answer was painting for aliens, the alien creatures, robots, robots, navicells and spaces, all this stuff.
The lessons of mathematical lessons I always became up with the textbook.
This is because creativity had to find a while.
And it happened to be interesting: The Jacques of Jacques Cousteau was involved a lot of the fact that there was an alien world right here on the earth.
Maybe I would never go into a alien world on a alien world.
It was very unlikely.
But that was a world where I could be true, right here on the earth rich and exotics of what I would ever imagine that I would ever imagine,
So, I decided that I would become a subjector of 15 years.
And the only problem was I living in a small country in a small country in the closer of the ocean.
But I didn't left to go down.
I assilled my father until he found a school in Buffalo, New York, I just spent the confinal where we live.
And so I was able to take the certified in a YMCA in the middle in Buffalo, New York.
And I wouldn't seen the ocean, for two years, until we moved in California.
Since then, in the last 40 years, I spent about 3,000 hours underwater, and 500 of these hours of these hours of these hours of these hours of these hours in the last hundreds of these hours in submersibles.
And I learned that the depth of the ocean, even the deep oceans, are riches of our imagination.
The imagination of nature is without respect to our human imagine.
Again, I'm intimacy from what I see when I do the immersions.
And my love story with the ocean continue to the ocean continue than it ever has never been there.
But when I choose a career, I chose to do films.
It looked like being the best way to concilize this smany to tell stories with the smania to create images.
And, from a guy, I designing costly comics and so on.
So to make film was the only way to put together and stories.
Everything came back.
And of course the stories I chose to tell were phants of science, "Aliens," "Aliens" and "The Aliens" and "The Abys."
And with "The Abys" I unized my love for the depth and diving with the realization of a film.
So, I've got the two passions.
Since "The Abys" came out of something interesting that was solve a narrative specific problem in that film, which is to create that kind of creature water creature of liquid water creature of the computer.
And so he was the first person to the early surface and animated to the computer that was ever seen in a film.
And even though the film doesn't have a lot of money, I would say that to malape was repair of something extraordinary, all the audience, all the audience.
You know, it's the law of Arthur Clarke for which every technology officiently advanced by the magia.
They were seeing something magic.
And that emotioned me a lot.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is something that must be adopted in the film.
So with "Terminator 2," my next film -- my next film --
Liking with the Industrial Light and Magic, we created the guy in that film. The successful depended on the film. The success.
And it worked. And we have a magic.
And we got the same result with a audience.
But we had a little bit more with that film.
So, by tracking a line between these two points of experience, I came to the conclusion that this would be a whole new world of creativity creativity artists.
So I put up a society with a society with Stan Winston, my major friend Ston, who was the principal trick and designers in that period, and we called it Digital Digital Digital Domain.
And the principle of society was to let us to the past, the analog press optic prints and so forth, and go directly to the digital production of digital production.
And so we did a competitive advantage for a little bit.
But we were left back to half of the '90s in the 1990s in the '90s, which is what we had founded the society.
So I wrote this text called "Avatar" with the intenance of push on the visual effects of visual computers, with emotional person, with emotional characters and realistic charactered to computer, and all the main generated computers.
And the whole thing was stayed to the myth.
The guys of the society told me that we're not going to be able to do it for a little bit.
So I slipped it and I did this film of a big ship that has a big narrowds.
And I throwed him there as a "Romeo and Giulietta on a ship.
It would be a epicture of epic, a passional movie.
Segretly, what I wanted to do was immersive to see the "Titanic."
That's why I did that film.
And it's truth. I didn't know.
But I convine. I said, "We're going to immerge it to the network. We're going to get it from alive.
We're going to use it for the beginning.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a fantastic."
And I convinced them to financial expedition.
It looks like crazy. But this brings back to the imagination that it makes reality.
Because we really created a reality and six months later, I found on a Russian and a half of depth in North Atlantic Atlantic from the Atlantic, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in the definition, but for real.
I was sleep.
And it takes a lot of preparation -- we had to build Child and a lot of other things.
But I was flowed by those deep immersions, it was like a space missions.
where everything was highly technical and rechieded huge planning.
You put it in this capture, you go down in this hair, where there are no hope to be saved to be savailable to be save back.
And I thought, "Fantastic. This is how to live in a science movie.
It's really amazing."
And so, I was from the depth of the exploration of the depth of the ocean.
Of course, curiosity, scientific component.
It was all. It was well.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't offer me.
Of course I could imagine a creature and create a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I saw out of the god.
In our afterwards of our expeditions, I've seen creature hydrothermal -- I had never seen before, things that no one had ever seen earlier, things that wasn't even described from science to the science that we have seen imagine.
So I was all about this and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, put my newspapers in Hollywood, and I do the Hollywood, and I do the explorer for a while.
So we began to planning these expeditions.
We found out of the Bismark and exploring it with robotic vehicles.
We went back to the Titanic.
We took small robots that we had created with the optic.
And the idea was to go inside and make a survey within the ship, which was never done.
Nobody had ever looked at the inside of the relittle, so we created the technology to do it.
So I was at the Titanic, sitting in a market of the Titanic, looking at the asks that seem like these, where I knew that they had sounded violinists.
And I'm driving a little robotic vehicle through the corridom of the ship.
When I tell you, I'm driving, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically present within the Titanic.
And it was the experience dejudence that has ever lived because I had ever lived because I had already before I had to turn the corner that the lights of the vehicle of the vehicle.
And the set was based on a replicity of the ship.
So it was an absolutely amazing experience.
And it really realized that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experiment experiment that you can experimented in the vehicle of existence.
It was very deeper.
And it might be a little bit of what may be going to happen between some decadecade when we start to have cyborn to have cybick for the exploration or other reasons in some kinds of the future that I can imagine, from the science.
So we did these expeditions, and it really started to appreciate what there was subt, like the open of the depth of the depth of the ocean animals.
It is along right here on the earth.
They live in a chemosynthesthesis --
They don't survive in a system based on the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight on the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight.
So, you see animals that live close to water water at 500 degrees.
It even looks like not impossibly impossible.
And I was very interesting about space science of space science, one again, is the flu of the science, from girl.
And I ended up in the space environment with NASA, sitting in the consultive of NASA, to planning space to planning for space of the pre-cost biomedy of the pre-cosmonauty, and all of these things, and all of these things, and all of these things, until to the international spatial station with our 3D.
It was fascinating.
But what I ended up to do was to bring the space scientists with us.
And bringing them down because they could have access -- -- astrobiology scientists, people interested in these extreme environments to these extremendous extremendous extremendous and so on.
So we were turning documentars, but we actually had science, and space science, space science.
I had closed the year, between being a child fan of phantom, to do those things to real.
And you know, during this path of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot of science. But I also learned a lot about leadership.
Everybody thinks that a regist should be a leader, whatever.
I didn't know anything about leadership before to do all those expeditions.
Why do I have to say, "What am I going to do I have to saying, "What am I doing here?
Why am I doing? What do I remember?"
You can't make all these spectacles.
At the bad we go to part.
People almost people think that I went in Titanics and "Avatar" and "Avatar," and that I was spring pollen.
I did all these film, all of these film, all of these documentary for a public record.
No family, no glory, no glory, what?
I am doing it for the task of the challenge -- and the ocean is the biggest challenge that there is the biggest challenge that you instance, and for the brilliance of people shape a team profoundly company.
Because we had all with 10-12 people, and working together, working together.
Sometimes in the sea for 2-three months of files.
And in that legam, you realize that the important thing is the respect that you have for them, and they have for you, when you finished a task that you can't explain anybody else.
When you go back to the Earth and says, "We've got to do this, and the optical fiber, and the optical fiber, all the technology, and the spread of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect that perhaps just have the police and knows that they have lived something together and they know that they haven't explain it.
Creating a bond respect a respect of respect.
When I went back to make my next film to make my next film -- I tried to apply the same principle of leadership is to respect the team and changing the team and change the team and changing the team and change their respect.
It's really changed dynamics.
And so here I was once on a little group, in the inexplored line to do "Avatar," with new technologies that didn't existed before.
Terribly emotional.
Tremendously engaging.
And we became a family, in the four-and-a-a-half.
And it completely changed my way to do film.
People having to say that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet.
For me, it was the way to do business, the process in itself, which was changed.
What can we can we take it now?
What are the lessons we learn?
I think the first is curiosity.
This is the most powerful thing we have.
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest reality.
And the respect of the group is more important than all of the world in the world.
Young people come up with me and say, "Dammakes me some advice to do this."
And I say, "Don't ponetimes.
Other people will do it for you, I don't make themselves, you don't realize against yourself.
And you'll rself."
NASA is always telling this sentence, "The error's not contemplato."
But the error has to be an option in the exploration, because it's like to be a saving in the vacuum.
And no important attempt that required innovation has been done without risks.
You have to be corruptions.
This is the thinking that I want to leave you, which is that in whatever you do, the mistakes is an option, but fearly -- thank you.
If I wanted to understand a single idea would be that the set of the data that we consume is the bigger of his parts, and instead of thinking about it. And instead of thinking about how to use the information to make new relationships so we see new relationships.
Here you see some statistics of organized mortality of organized mortality.
This instrument that I use is a little experiment.
It's called Pivot, and Pivot, and Pivott can filter a single cause of death, let's say accidents.
And yet we see new relationships.
The reason is that in the central part of the central part of the most fragile.
We can make a step back, and reorganize the data because of death of death, we see that circulators and cancer are of India's greatest injurs and cancer.
If we go on and film for the age, we see under 40, we see that accidents are the causes of death that you're going to worry about more.
She says closer than for men.
So you've got to visualize that information and data in these way is a little bit like swimming in a sea of swwood information.
And if we can do it with raw data because don't even do with the content?
For example, we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated every Sports Illustrated print.
Everything in the network.
You can go into your rooms and try you.
With Piving a decade.
Or a specific year.
It can be isolating a number in particular.
For example, we take athletes that appear in this number, their sports.
I'm a fan in LArmstrong, so I click here and I see all of the numbers in which looks like LArmstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a look at it, I could think "Why don't you look at all the cycle?"
I do a step back and turn it out to the visual.
And I see Greg Lemond.
So you have to realize that when you navigate between the information in this way closer or further, it's not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not a browser.
But you do something else different.
It's a half a half of a second that we can use information.
We still have this idea that it can seem a little bit crazy.
We've taken every single page of Wikipedia, and we reduced it to a little bit that is in a small synthy and an icony that indicates the area that indicates of tematic.
I just show you the first 500 between the most visited Wikipedia.
Even in this screened screen.
It turns out what tematic areas of Wikipedia.
And so the government points of government --
She's this option we see that the Wikipedia more often associated with this voices are "Personages of Time Magazine.
This is significant because it makes it emerging something that in the pages of Wikipedia is not there.
And you see it just by making a step back.
If you take one of these reases can then zooming on the categoria "Personages of Time Magazine.
and see them all.
So I see most of the most of government comes from government is from government in the world of science.
Here's my head.
It comes from music.
And, quite interesting thing interesting.
So we saving all the winners of my TED.
For the first time, we're really navigating in the network as if it was a network, but at a level of high abstraction.
I want to show you another thing that might be surprise --
This is the New York Times.
And Pivot, this application -- we don't like browser, because it's not a browser, but it still is to see the Web pages -- we add this technology for zoom to every Web, like this.
I can make a step back, and he can go to a specific section. This is important because the only see the Web pages so shows me to see all my navigation in the same identical well.
I can zooming on what I did in a moments.
Here you see the state of the game that I just presented.
I can see other things that I've seen in the day.
If I want to take a step back, and see all I can do it at pieces my story or the history of my research.
Here I tried to look for the motor Bing the motor Bing, here for Labs Pivot.
And from here I can zoomare on my page and just relaunching from here.
One metaphor reused a lot of times and in every case the result is more than the result of the partments of parts.
Today, the data has seen as a kind of a bunch of mal.
It talks about subsicareful of information.
It's talking about range in the data.
And if we put it all subject if we put the web underwater on the Web, instead of pass from one thing to the other, we used to see the structure that otherwise can we see the structure that otherwise can we see the structures that otherwis?
And then instead of hearing us in the data we could really extract information.
Instead of taking information, we can pull out of knowledge.
And by knowledge knowledge.
And with that thank you.
All of these days all talk about happiness.
I asked to count the number of books containing the word "happiness in the title and published in the last five years, have stopped to contact after 40, and there were many more.
There's an enormous waves of interest on happiness, between the researchers.
There is very "coaching" about happiness.
Everybody would want to make the happiest people and happy.
But although, this is a series of work, there are a series of cognitive that somehow cognitive that in some way make it impossible elaborate ideas correct on happiness.
My talk about today about today is going to look most cognitive traps.
And about it is profane people who think about their happiness, and it's about studying and happiness, because we share that we confuses like everybody else.
The first of these traps is the reluttance to admit the complexity.
It turns out that the word happiness is no longer a word useful word as we appear to find camps.
I think that you can restringing to a particular significant but in the line of massive, we will have to have this acception, and we have to adopt the most complicated vision of what well.
The second traps is the confusion between memory and memory. It's basically about to choose between being happy in life and happy in life and be happy in life.
And these are two concepts of different concept of happiness.
And the third is the illusion of the focused that we can't think about any circumstances that influences on the well-being without distory about well-being without distory.
I mean, it's a real cognitive trap.
and there's no way to do the right thing.
I would like to start with one example of one person which, after a session of questions and answers and answered a story.
It's not clear -- Disse while he listened a symphony of the absolutely magnific music.
And then added it in a very emotionally emotional that he had rolled the entire experience.
But it wasn't true.
What he had been rolling was the remember of experience.
He had lived the experience.
And he heard for 20 minutes of the wonderful music.
but that he didn't count because he stayed with a certain -- I remember; the remember was sunning, and the remember was everything that remains.
What this episode episode says, in the bottom, is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two "y."
There is a slides that lives in the present and you know the present, and it is able to revive the past, but that it practice only has the present.
This is about the experiences that lives the experience and the doctor of the doctor ask -- you know when the doctor ask him, when the doctor ask here?"
And then there is the reminds," it's about the "feels that you remember the points, and it's about the history of our life, and it's that "know" to what the doctor's doctor?
or anything like your journey in Albania?" or something like this.
Those are two different entities, the knowledge that lives an experience and what if you remember, and what if you remember, the confusion of happiness.
You know that remember, it's a singing.
And this process starts with a fundamental answer of our reminds -- it starts immediately.
We don't tell stories only tell stories when we decided to tell them.
Our memory tells us stories, whatever, what you can be our experiences is a story.
Let me start with one example.
This is a old studio.
It reports the experiences of two patients during a sweet procedure.
I'm not going to get me in detail. It's not even sweet today, but it was painful when this study was sweet in the 1990s.
She asked the patients every 60 seconds.
And here is the results for two patients.
Those are their results.
If you wonderful one?"
It's a very simple question.
Clearly, the Patient B: The Patient B:
And his colony hit led over every minute of the sweets of the sweet As the patient of the patient of the patient of As or more.
But now there is another question, "How much these patients think of the suffering?"
And here's the source of the Patient As had a remember of the colony of the column long-worst of the Patic B.
The stories of the colony stories were different than a particular part of the procedure is the way in terms of the procedure is particularly positive -- but one of the two is different -- but one of the two is particularly worse of the other.
And the worst is that where the pain was the final moment.
It's a negative story.
How do I know it?
Why do we asked these people after colony after the colon-a-a-time, and even distance has been the experience, all consideredit?"
And it turned out out of the worst for B, in the order for B, in the remember.
So this is a conflict conflict between the saming that lives the experiences.
From the person of the experience, is that experience, is clear that has suffered magally.
So what you could do for the A, and we actually have clinic, and we actually actually did clinic, and it was really done and it would be able to be able to be able to the colony of the Patient As tending the column without smoot.
This is a little bit of pain in the patient in the patient, but just a lot less than before.
And by doing this for a couple minutes, the holds that lives the experience of the Pati's going to be worse -- and the handle experiences of the Patient As a lot better than his experience.
How do you call a story?
And this is true for stories that are from the remember that for the stories that we invented a story, are the changes and the final moments and final.
The finals are very, very important and in this case, the final has dominated.
So, the sames that lives the experiences lives his life in a continue.
It has moments in which lives that suspected and and questions: what happens to these moment?
And the answer is simple.
They're allowing to say that most of the moments of our life -- as I calculated them -- I mean that in a life, psychological says hard about three second seconds of the Most means that in a life, we connect about 600 million in which they don't let it.
Most are completely ignored from the sames that remember.
And yet in some way you have a feeling that should count, that what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
They're the limited resources that we're spending while we're in this world.
And how to spend it, it seems to detect them, but it's not the story that reminds for us.
So we have a slides that reminds and a slide that lives are pretty different.
The biggest difference between two is how to treatment.
From the perspective of the experience, if you walk in the vacations, and the second week is funny as a week of two weeks is two weeks is two weeks is a week of a week.
But this is not absolutely the way that it works the him.
For the slides that remember, a two weeks is better than a week of a week of vacation because there are no new reminds in addition to addy.
You don't have changed history.
And in this way, the time is the critical variables that distinction is that remember from the sames that experiences.
The time has a limited impact on this story.
Well, the same, the saming experiences more than remembering and tell stories.
It's actually the fact that it takes decisions because, if we consider a patient that has happened, for example, two colony colony with two different doctors and is deciding what two different docks, what the doctors is what it is going to be the remind that will be the rest of choice.
The experience that lives experiences has no voice in these choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experience, but between the reminds of those experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future as experience.
We think of our future as ancient ancient memories.
In fact, you can think of this situation, like a tyranny of the same, and you can think of the same, and you can think of how to turn the experiences that lives the experiences through experiences of any experiences the experiences of any experiences the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of any of the experiences of the experiences of any of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the across the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences
I have a feeling that when we go into the vacation is often the case that you have a good part of the service of the service of our slides that remember.
And this is a little hard to justify.
Oh, how do we consume our memories?
This is one of the explanations, which is given for the predomination of the team.
And when I think about that, it is in mind of a few years ago, which is a few years ago, which is one of the best vacation of my life, and I think I relatively often relatively often.
And I probably spend thinking about that journey of that journey of three weeks, in the last four years.
If I ever have opened the sign with the 600 photographs of the journey of the journey of three weeks of journey that you can translate a bad hour and and a half. It looks like.
Well, I could be a little bit extremely extreme, in my shot consumption, but even if you do more than that, but even though you do more than that, a genuine question.
Why are we going to heavy memory respect to the weight that we have the experience?
Now I want you to think about a experiment with thought.
Imagine that during the next vacations, you know that at the end of the vacation of the vacation of all photographs will be destroyed, and you will take a medicine for the amnesia so you don't remember anything.
Would you be weigh? And if you could choose a different vacation? And if you could choose a conflict between two slides and you have to think about how to solve conflict and effects and in effect is not so obvious, if you think in terms of time you have a answer.
And if you think in terms of remember, you could get another answer.
The because we choose the vacation that we do, is a problem that takes us in front of the two of the side.
The two hundreds of happiness.
There are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use, one for everyone else.
So what is the experience?
And then you wonder: how happy are the moments in the slide?
And it's about -- happiness for moments it's a complicated process.
What are the emotions that we can measure?
And, by the way, now we are able to make us good idea of the happiness of the happiness that lives the experiences in time.
If you ask about the happiness of the teams that remember, it's a completely different thing.
This is not how happy a living person alive.
This is how satisfaced or compleasy is the person when it thinks to his life.
It's a very different.
Anybody is not going to be able to distinguish these two notions, not to create confusions of happiness, and I appeared to a group of well-being, and I appeared to a lot of well-being, and exactly in this way.
The difference between happiness, and experiences the experiences and experiences of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the sources of the efforts to measuring the two separately, the Gallup has a world's institute where more than half a million people have been subway of their life and their experiences.
And there were other studies in this direction.
So in the last few years, we started learning about the happiness.
And the biggest lesson that we learned, is that they're very different.
You might know how much a person is satisfaced with your life, and yet it doesn't tell you about how happy they are living their lives and the reverse.
To give you an idea of the correlation is about 0.5.
Which means that if you mean that if you mean that if you mean that if you mean that if you mean that if you measurement?
Well, you know something about its height, but with a lot of uncertainty.
You always have a little bit of uncertainty.
If I tell you somebody thinks that his life is at the eight in a scale from one to 10 to a 10 of happy -- you will be very uncertainly uncertainly about how experiences.
So the correlation is low.
We have a certain knowledge of what controls is happy --
We know that money is very important, the goals are very important,
We know that being happy means to be satisfacts with people that we like, to spend time with people that we have.
There are other pleasures, but these are the main these are the main ones.
So if you want to massive the happiness of the two hundreds of the two of the guys will end up doing very different things.
The conclusion of what I said is that we shouldn't think about happiness as well-being.
This is two completely different ideas completely different.
In more quickly quickly, another reason why we can't think we can think in a linear happiness is that we don't take attention to the same things when we think about life.
So if you do the simple questions about how happy people in California, you can't get the correct answer.
When you ask this question, think that you should be more happy in California, which in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contraster between California and other places and other places and other places and other places and other places --
Well, it turns out that climate is not so important for the same, and it's not very important to the experiences and it's not very important for the sames that reflects that is what happy.
But since the sat is that reflects is in charge, you might end up -- some powerful people in California.
And it's interesting what will happen to be going to happen to people that turn into California in the hope of being happy.
Well, the sames that lives the experience is not going to become happy.
We know it.
But something will happen to be more happy, because when they think they're going to remember how terrible is going to remember how terrible time in Ohio.
And they're going to think about having the right decision.
It's very hard to think clearly about well-being and I think I had the idea of how hard it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question.
Thank you very much.
When we were at the telephone a couple of weeks ago, that a interesting result that a interesting result of the Gallup.
Is it something that thinks we can share we going to share that we still have a few minute?
Daniel Kahneman: Okay.
I believe that the result that we found in the Gallup is a number that we weren't expected expected to find.
We found that, with a reference to happy about the experience.
When we looked at how we heard of a 60,000 dollars a year, we discovered that under a 60,000 dollars a year, for American year, for American year, for Americans, on a very vast sample of about 600,000 Americans, on a very vast sample of 600,000 American representative representative of 600,000 dollars a year.
CA: 60,000 dollars a year, 60,000 dollars a year, people are ununhappy, and they become progressively more unhappy than that, we find a poor, All of that we find a flap.
I mean, I've seen a rarely of the lines.
Clearly, what happens is that the money doesn't buying happiness of experience, but the lack of money in experience, but the lack of money. And we can measure that misery very, very clearly.
In terms of the other hand, the same, it's another story.
More money, more content.
This is not going to be emotional on emotions.
CA: But Danny, all the efforts of American efforts are about life, the freedom of happiness.
If people take this discovery, in this discovery, it practices everything we believe, for example, the politics on the tissue and so on.
There is the possibility that politicians and politics, and the country in general, can take a discoveries like that seriously and bring a public politics.
DK: You're that I think it recognize the role of happiness in the public politics.
The press of consideration will be slowed in the United States, but in the U.K., it's becoming reality, and in other states.
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about politics.
It will take us a little bit and people will begin to argue if they want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the valuable of life.
As a happiness to acknowledge different directions to how you think of how you think, and second you think of the slide that it makes the experiences.
All this influence will be politics, I think, in the 19th that well.
In the United States, are doing some efforts to measure the experience of happiness of the population.
And that, I think, it will come up with the next decade, maybe two of the country.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this argument, or for the less should be, the most interesting political discussion to follow in the next years.
Thank you very much for behavioral economy.
Thanks Danny Kahneman.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate.
It can seem to seem strange in my job to the foundation of vaccines, things to invent and giving the world to help two billions of the poorest people to live lives.
But climate and energy, in fact, they're extremely importantly important for this people, are more important for them than anybody else in the world.
A lot of climate worst for many years old.
It will be too much rain or too little bit.
They will change them in ways that their environment simply can't support it.
It brings to the fame. At incertainty.
So, climmatics, they are going to be terribles.
Even the cost of the energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you can lower the price of one thing, to reduce poverty, to reduce poverty, to choose much energy.
The price of energy is down in time.
And a civilization progress to progress in energy field.
The coal revolution of coal revolution that industrial revolution.
And even in the 20th century we seeing a rapid decline in the price of electricity that explain why we have frigerators, we can create modern materials and do so many things.
So in the rich world, we are how much about electricity in a situation.
But while the price scenes, for examples of half of the half of the CO2.
CO2 is is a warming the planet, and his equation is very simple.
CO2 empowered a temperature, which induces very negative.
Effects on the climate, perhaps even worse, in the sense that the natural ecosystems can't get up to these rapids changes and then collapse.
The valutation of how you increase temperature because of a CO2, and as each of CO2, and as each one of the two things, it's uncertainly, but not much.
And there is certainly uncertainty about how negatives will be extremely negative.
And I often asked to the best scientists -- we really have to reduce the emissions.
We cannot just reducing them to a quarter?
And the answer is that, until we down to zero, the temperature will continue to salie.
It's a great challenge challenge.
It's not like to say, "Let's go through a 3.5, under a 3.5, under 3."
This is not about "leave it a whil."
This is where we have to get zero.
Now, we empowered a lot of CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons.
About 20 tons for every American.
For the poors of the poors of poor, is less than a ton capita.
The world's average is about five tons pro.
And somehow, we have to make progress that amount to zero.
The emissions are constantly at all.
Only some changes have changed this tendency, so we have to go from the increase to the declining up to the zero.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series of multiplications.
We've got the left, CO2, the CO2, who have to be building, and the farm on the right are population, the services that in average every person use, the average of every person use, the average of every person usually energy.
We go to each factor and we see how we can see how we can do it.
Probably, one of these numbers must let up in almost zero.
It's about high high school.
We see a while.
The first factor is population.
The world has today 6.8 billion habitants.
We go to the nine billion.
If we do a good job with the new vaccines, health health reproductive, we can declined 10, 15 percent of the 10, 15 percent.
The second factor is the services that we use it.
It knows everything, the food that we eat, the vestarium, the TV, the warming.
They're wish, and free of poverty means to provide these services for almost everybody in the world.
And it's a good thing that this number of increases.
In the rich world, in the rich world, we probably could save and use men, but in average, every year, this number of slip.
And so complex, the amount of service services are going to be than double.
This is a very simple example of service.
You've got the illumination in your house to do company, but these guys -- and they read and read their own company, and they read their company.
How much of efficiency -- E, the energy for the unity of services.
This is not increasing it.
Thanks to many inventions, new ways of illuminate, automobiles made different different different constructions of services can declined to a lot of services can declined energy.
In some services you can reduce 90 percent.
There are other services, like fertilizers, or the airplane, or airplane, where the margins of improvement are very, very infertilizens are very, very infertilizers.
So, complex times, in the best consumed energy can reduce from three to three perhaps to six times.
But these first three factors reduce emissions from 26 in the best of the best of the case 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
Let's look at the fourth factor, the key amount of CO2 embodies for energy.
The question is, can we reduce the zero?
If you burns carbon it.
If you burn natural gas, no.
Almost all of the ways to produce electricity today the renewable and nuclear CO2.
So what we have to do on global scale -- and it's to create a new system.
And we need energy miracohics.
Col terms of "mirac," I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. The person is a miracle.
Internet, and his services, I'm a miracle.
People here today have participated creation of a lot of miracles.
We usually don't have a scadence, a date within which I think you have miracle.
Soney, it's a window, and something else.
In this case we have to drive all the speed, and to make a miracle in very rise of very rise --
I asked myself how to illustrate that concept that?
Can example of natural example that captured the imagination of people?
I took a year ago, when I brought to the mosquitoes, and people found it fun.
And he made them of the fact that, in the world, there are people who live with mosquitoes.
This is my idea for energy.
I decided that to fly slight would be this year my contribute.
Here's the lights here.
They tell me that not point, they could not get out of the boat.
So now we can invent it like this, but not going to be help.
We need solutions, a lot of them or so many that they are, that works on great scale and very affified, and although it's exploring in many directions, I think that just five can surprising effects of important.
I looked like the bong, the geo-fusion nuclear fusion of nuclear fuel biofuel.
They could also give some contributes, and if they can do more than I expect that I expect me expected that we have to work on each of these five, and not snone of these five, and not swalks at all.
We go for the first fossil fuel fuel fuel, carbon or gas or natural gas or gas that it is.
Here we can be simple seems to be simple, but it's not to capture the CO2, after the combustion, to the outside of the field of the field, put it somewhere, and hope that we have to stay it up.
There are experimental technologies that capture 60 percent of CO2, 80 percent of CO2, but reach 100, will be very complicated and it's going to be hard to deal with all of this CO2.
The most spinous issue is still that in the long term.
Who will be?
Who is something that is literally billions of times more voluminous than every other kind of imagine, like nuclear or other?
It's a huge volume.
So it's a difficult problem.
The other source would be the nuclear.
But nuclear presents three big problems.
The cost, especially in very regulated, is high.
The issue of safety safety that nothing can go wrong wrong, sick the slides of human operators, and that the combustible doesn't come come to beautiful.
And how do you manage the scores?
Malgrade redoctor, concerns are so much.
People need to be renched.
So you have a very hard problems -- so that you could solve, and on what you should be work.
The last three of the five sources.
These are the people that often definitely."
And to say the real advantage of not to require a combustible combustible combustible.
The first is that the density of energy produced with these technologies is decidedly inference to a central electrical center.
This is about "harvest," and so many kilometers of square kilometers of a thousands of times more extended than a normal electric.
And these sources.
The sunlips all day, not all the day, not all the day, and the wind suffers.
So if you depends on these sources, you have to find a way to find an electrical power even when the source doesn't produce.
Grosse challenges attending us on the front of the costs.
And the distribution.
For example, let's say that this energy source in the outside.
So not just need technology, but you also have to do the technology, but you also have to do the risk connection.
And finally, the issue of the accumulate problem.
For estimate the size of the problem, I analyzed all kinds of bacterial batteries today -- and whatever, I confronted them with the amount of electrical energy electrical energy electrical energy electrical energy that all of the bacteries now in production could be able to produce less than 10 minutes of all of the energy.
So we really need a big advance, a little bit of a 100 times respect to the approaches now in use.
which is not impossible, but it's not very simple.
This problem is already when the sources "intermitt" produce more dels, say, 20 or 30 percent of consumption energy.
If you go to those sources for 100, you need a miracle battery battery --
But how are we going to add this street? What's the right approach?
Is this a Manhattan? What could you solve the problem?
A lot of company, at hundreds and hundred to work.
We need at least people in each of these five sectors.
Most of them, looking at them, definitely define them, which is a good.
And I think here, in the TED group of TED, many people are already working in these fields.
Bill Gross a different companies between which an eSolar that a vantage of large technologies.
Khosla is investing in the dozens of companies that are doing great things and they have interesting things and have interesting and they have interesting my support to all this.
Nathan Myhrvold Myhrvold a company, which is follow the street of nuclear --
There were some innovations, modular nuclear -- modular nuclear --
But from a lot of time, the sector, the sector, that there are some good ideas around is not so amazing.
The idea of Terrapower is that, instead of burning only the uranium, the U235 percent of the available, we decided to burning the U238, 999999999 percent of the U238, 99999 percent of it.
For the truthanks, but it was never adequately provided if it would work or noticed if it would work or not, just because of modern supercomputers today, you can do a simulation and see that yes, with the right materials, it seems to work.
And since it burning 99 percent of the uranium, the structure of the best costs.
They burns burns, and they use as a fuel combustible today, that become from the problem that they were, from the problem that they were, a resource.
It turns out the uranious fuel of proced. It's kind of a canlandscape.
It's kind of like a wood burn that burn. It's called progressive.
From the point of the combustible problem is solve.
Here's a picture of a place in Kentucky.
This is scared, 99 percent of the uranium, which has been taken the part of the uranium, and so that it is called the uranible uran.
These energy would give them energy to the United States for centuries.
And by filtering water with a economic process, with a economic process, there would be enough for the rest of this planet.
So a lot of challenges attended, but this is an example of hundreds of ideas that we need to progress.
How should we measure our progres?
What should you count your pays?
We Identify the goal -- and then we valued the pursues.
You've heard a lot of people talking about 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's very important to be able to be able to do it.
20 percent of agricultural countries, and from a little agriculture.
At that point, we have solved the deforestation and production of cement.
To get to 80 percent, therefore countries, including countries like China, will have to replace completely their electrical production.
The other question is, are we doing this technology to zer?
Do we put it in the developed countries?
We are we spreading it even else?
It's a important.
It's a key element of the page.
Do you go to the page of 20?
And that should have the same two expects.
We should be implementing of efficiency measureductions.
As we employ, minor minor is the total amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this matter, doing things that doesn't behave great reductions -- it's just a part, or even slightly inference to the innovation of new inventions.
We have to push these progress at all speed, and we can measure the speed from the number of company, projects, pilots, and regular regulations.
Most books have been written about it.
The Al Gor, "The Gors," and David McKay, "Sustainable Sustainable Sustainable Without the Hot Air."
These books beyond the problem and create a context in which to do the debate.
A lot of things must have to have contemporary contemporary.
So I have a wish,
A very concrete wish that we have the technology necessary.
If I had to choose one wish for the next 50 years, you know. You can choose the president of the country, the realization of a vaccine, which I can make this thing that cost the half of a vaccine, which is not to make CO2, I wouldn't make CO2, I would choose this last ma.
It would be that in the greatest impact.
If this wisn't going to be going to make the fraction between who thinks and who long-terrible in the U.S. and China, between countries and China, among countries and rich, the life of those two billion of people will be great.
What do we have to do we do?
What am I inviting you to take the initiative and proced?
It's necessary a larger research.
When countries to get together in places like Copenhagen, they shouldn't just talk about CO2.
They should be discuss the program of the innovations, and stupid how much is that we can invest in these innovative approaches.
We need incentives, taxes on CO2, the "cap and trade," instruments that evidence the cost of the pollution.
We have to spread the message.
We have to make this more rational dialogue and understandable, and it has to including the choices of government.
It's a challenge wish wall, but I think able.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you. Just to know more about Terrapower on Terrapower --
first of all, you can give us a idea of investment?
Bill Gates: Read the software, to buy the supercomputer, to be all of the great scientists, what we already did, requires only tens of millions, and even when we have tested the materials in a Russix of a millional reactor, to be just talk about hundreds of millions.
The difficult thing is to build the pilots of various billions, the competent, the place in which will be built the first one that will be built the first example.
Once we built the first one, if it works like announced -- it's going to be the Colombo, because the costs, the density of energy that we know today.
CA: So if I figure that well, this imples the construction of a vertical combustible combustible nuclear fuel.
And then the process starts from the high and progress towar?
BG: Yeah. The reactors, today, are being continuously, a lot of people, many controls that can not work, opening and opens --
It's not good.
If the combustible is very cheasier and you can do it for 60 years, put it in and forgotten all of the complexity.
It is burns burns for sex.
CA: A nuclear nuclear implanting that makes out of itself!
BG: Yeah. Well, you can leave them up there, then you can let them into another reactor.
And we're going to begin with the existing rejects, now conserved in the vases of cooling or containers close to reactors.
They'll be our first fuel.
So what was a problem of conventional reactors, and the volume of the nostris, and the volume of the refying of the refying of the reality will be reality.
CA: But when I talk around the world of the potential of this technology, where is more interest interest of this technology, where more interest to his realization?
BG: Well, there's not a place place in particular, and there are all these are interesting rules on everything that is defined nuclear -- and we have a very interest.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I just met the Segretary for Energia.
We've talked about how this idea became to the current program.
I'm optimist. French and Japanese did in this field.
It's a variation about something that has been done.
This is a sustaining improvement, but it's a quickly reactor that a lot of countries have built a very good candidate reactor.
CA: I mean, what are the days and the probability that one thing like to do you realize that?
BG: Well, for one of these projects at the entire scale that produces energy, which is not very, we talk about 20 years to design it.
This is the scadence that the environmental models,
Terrapower, if everything good, which is not wonderful point, it could easily this goal.
And now they are, fortunately, the dozens of companies in the sector, whether their research works, if the fundaments for their pilots of piloss of their pilots of pilots of their pilots of pilots of compety.
And it's better if a lot of solution will have successful, because at that point, you can remember to a set of solutions.
It's necessary that at least a success.
CA: Would you talk about important, revolutionary, this is the biggest you know?
BG: A energy revolution is the most important.
It would be able without the environmental win the environmental is really much more important.
We have other innovators.
We don't know their jobs like this, but one is the nuclear nuclear -- a different approach.
There's a liquid reactor. It seems hard to me to do that, but maybe they say the same thing of us.
So there are different different things, but the beautiful is that a molecule, a molecule, a million times more energy than a million times more energy than a molecule, if you can deal with the negestern aspects -- if you can deal with the negative assumption on the environment, in terms of effects on the environment, in terms of the environment.
CA: And if it doesn't work, what do we do?
We shouldn't begin to adopt measures to try and keep the temperature on the stable lands?
BG: If you find you in that situation, it's a little bit like when you eat you, and you have a heart attack.
Where do you go to that point? You might have to have a surgeon or something like this.
There is a lot of research line, which are various techniques that are various techniques that would slow down the warming face that would slow down to 20 or 30 years in which we coordinate the action.
It's like to stick a policy policy.
I hope you haven't need.
Some people say that you shouldn't even work in the policy because you might be in the policy because you could be savailed to save you.
I don't think it's a choice, says the importance of the problem of the problem of the geoengineering of the solution of the solutions in the case in which events precipitine, or the innovations.
CA: If I had a sentence: if I had a phrase or two to dir them, how could you persuade them that they have come back?
BG: Well, unfortunately, there are different types of skeeps and the ones of scientific argues.
Some people say that there is a negative feedback to the cloud of the cloud that they die the effects of warming.
They're very, very few things that you can only say that there is a probability on a million that you have this probability on a million that you have the main the AIDS.
You start a mistay and you paying the consequences only very later.
And so, when you're pressed by emergence, the idea of doing sacrifices that you see results that you see results --
Sacrifices for achieved away.
In fact, the IPPPPC is not necessarily perspective, the worst case. There is people in the rich world that looks at the IPPC and says, okay, it's not so bad.
The fact is that uncertainty should be push to action.
But my dream is that, if we can make economically, and to respect the vines on the CO2, so I don't care about the CO2, that I don't care if you don't emette CO2, almost preferency that I would be emitem because it's more economic technologies.
CA: It would that be your answer to the reasoning of the Bjorn Lomb, which if you invest all your energies and trying to solve the problem of CO2, your other goals -- will be sacrificed. And that will be sacrificated. And what do you mean to do you have better to do it, it means to make it resources to do you do that?
BG: Well, the sacross and developing --
We say that the U.S.A should spend 10 billion in more than they do now is not as the ingen.
It shouldn't distrate resources.
The things that behave a lot of money, and here people are reasonable to deal of economic solutions.
For me is most of that, I know.
And unless you fund learning curve to learn curve to learning, close to the point where it's going to become very economic efforts are concentrated in technologies that have the potential to lower in technologies that have the potential to lower the costs.
If the alternative powerful energy as a cost-rich energy, so that only rich rich the rich can afford to pay the energy can allow the energy five times as much without change.
The disaster would be for those two billion.
And the Lomborg has seen his positions.
His arguments is, "Why isn't you discussing more than Ricerk and Switnes?"
For his past, you still get it between the skeptics, but he realized that it's a swearing group, and so he's a bunch of Ricerk and Svilup.
And it's a question I think it's appropriate that I think it's appropriate it.
It's amazing how little you invest in research and development.
CA: Well, I think of the majority of the audiences of the audience saying that I hope to see your desire to become reality.
BG: Thank you.
I want to sharing with you a discovery that I did a few months ago, while I was writing a Wired.
I always have my dictionary of the synonymous, whenever I write something, but I had finished to the articticle and I realized that I never in my life looking for the word "disastable," to see what I was going to find it.
Let me read you the result.
"Deat," aggettive -- indeed, unuseful, unuseful, unuseful, untiled, slamined, until, untiled, until itself, impoor, impoverty, very powerful paralyzed and debols. Sena, decrept with the circulation, cut out of the circulation, clate and debols.
Contrari: In form, lucky.
I was reading this high list to a friend to a friend and at the beginning, it was so ridiculous, but I had to stopped my voice, and I had to stopped my voice, and I had to stop out of shock and the impact that the axis and the impact of these words have left me.
You know, we're talking about one of my old dictionary.
I'm thinking, it's going to be an old, right.
But, in fact the building was early 80s.
when I was starting the elementary schools and learning what was out of my family and learning what existed out of my family and other children and the world around me.
And unuseful to say that, thank God I didn't use the dictionary of the synonymous,
I mean, from this explanation looks like that I was born in a world that you see someone like me as one who has nothing positive in any way for them, whatever, who has been celebrated for opportunities and the adventure that my life has procured.
So, I'm immediately going to see on 2009 in the network, expected to find a review without value.
This is the version of description.
Unfortunately, it's not very much better.
I find the last two words under the last couple of words uncomfortable, "inter" and healthy and healthcare about the words.
That's what we believe people when we get them with these words.
It's about valuable values behind these words, and how we build these values.
Our flu language our thinking and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, a lot of civilizations, including that Greek and the Romana, believed that it was more powerful than the verbly voices to existence.
So, what do we want to bring to exist, a person who is limited, or a person with more force?
So if you seeing something simple like to nominate a person, a child, we could put it on a baby, we could put them on their force.
Do we wouldn't we open to them?
One person who opened the doctor -- it was the doctor of that I was the docton Wilmington Wilmington.
His name is Dr. Pizush Pizusual.
ItaloAmerican, whose known was too hard to be very hard to pronounce for most Americans, so it became doctors.
And he was wearing doctor, and he was a perfect colored and he had a perfect to work with children.
I was almost whatever of the time I spent in hospital, with the exception of physical sessions.
I had to do what seemed to be infinite repetition with these big elastic, in different colors, you know, in different colors -- to help build the muscle.
And I hate these elastic elastics anything.
I hate them hate them, really hated.
And, you know, I knew already, like a five years, with Dr. I have to try to get out of these exercizes, Inuan.
And, one day, it came to one of my seats and unexorablies, these sites.
And he said, "Wow, Aimee, six a child so fortune, I think that I went to break one of those phases.
"When the break, I will give you 100 dollars."
Now, clearly was just a little maneuef of doctors to make me exercizes that I didn't want to do the front of perspective of the second plan, what he did, the second plan, what he did did did was to give a different shape at a different shape of day.
and turn it into an interesting experience for me.
And I wonderful today, the entity of his vision, and his declaration about me as a fortune child, he redefined my view of myself in a lucky, power and the personal person to the future.
This is an example of how adults with positions of power can inflaming the force of a child.
But, in the first one with those definitions of the vocabulary of the synonyms, our language of our language of our language to the reality that everybody wants to see if you like.
Our language, it's not at the step of changes of our society, many of which have been created by technology.
of course, from a average point of view -- my legs, my legs, the operations, the laboration of the head-ey-ey-ey-eyed bodies that are helping people to cooperate with their skills, and move to the ability that nature's ability that nature has to be able to the platforms of the social network, allows of the social network, allows of the social networks to description of if you can description groups.
So, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly what has always been a truth, which each one has something rare and power to offer to our society, and the human ability to adapt us is our biggest quality.
The human ability to adapt it, it's something interesting, because people always wanted to talk to me a difficulty sources and I have to admit challen.
This sentence has never gone good, and I sented up in the answer to people to this about that, and I think I'm starting to understand why.
It's subject in this sentence, insurprisable adversity, is the idea that successful or happiness, is to reemerging from the other side of a challenge of this experience, if my success in life of this experience, if my success in life has come from a schiving schiving or circumnavigation of a life with the protess, or what people lose like my disability.
But in fact, we have changed, we have changed, logically, from a challenge, physically or both.
And I would suggest that it's a good thing.
It's not a obstacle that we have to add our life.
It's part of our life.
And I mean to think it's like my shadow.
Sometimes unning, and sometimes almost for anything, but it's always with me.
And, of course, I don't have trying to decrease the impact, the weight of a person.
There are adversities and challenges in life, and it's all true and relative to every single person, but the question is not if you have adversities or or not, but how you go to deal with it.
So, our responsibility is not simply to protect people to us.
And we do a damage to our children when we make them feel that they're not ready to fit up.
There's an important difference and distinction between the medical medical objective of being an amputed person, and the subjective of the society that I seen to me or not.
And truth, the only disability is that I had to deal that I had to face is if the world ever thought I could be described by those words.
In our wishes to protect those that we loving a cool truth, really, the truths of their medical prognews of their expectancy for their expectation of life, we have to be safe the first morning. We have to be somebody.
Perhaps the model of looking at just what there is just and how to put it in you and how to put it back to the most subject that the disease of the subject.
In not to be a person in the complete, not to do to understand its potentiality, we are creating another disease of disease in addition to the natural suffering that already.
We're effectively giving a value of a person in our community.
So we have to see through the disease and within the elency of human ability.
And much more importantly, there's a relationship between those insufficiency perceived and our greatest creativity.
So, it's not to be proposed to svalue, these number of research as something that we want to avoid or whatever we want to be able to find those opportunities tell in a accident.
So maybe the idea that I want to explain is that there is not what as to be able to be able to be able to be able to use a term of the lotation of liber, maybe even dance, perhaps also dance to use together.
And, perhaps, if we look at an accident, like a natural and useful, and we are fewer from his presence.
This year, we celebrate the birth of Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, and it was 150 years ago, when he wrote about evolution, that Darwin has illustred, I think, the truth to the human character.
And to say it in another way, is not the strongest of the expects that survive, and it's not even the most smart, is the most smart, is the most smart changes.
The conflict is the genesis of cracking.
Darwin, by Darwin, between other things, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and developed from the spirit of human spirit through the conflicts in transformation.
So, again transformation, adaptation; it's our biggest quality.
And, maybe, we don't know what we did, we don't know what we're made of.
Maybe that's what adversity gives us adversity, a sense of hold.
So we can make a gift.
We can re-imagine adversity like something more difficult.
Maybe we can see it as a change.
The adversity is a change that that we haven't adapted.
I believe that the biggest adversity that we created is this idea of normal. Now, who is normal?
There is no normal, there's a typical. There is a typical. There is no normal.
And you want to meet those few grid of grill?
I don't think about it.
If we changed this paradigm from one of how to get the normality to be able to be able to be adigned, or potentiality, we can understand the force of so many kids, we can understand the strength of so many children, and inviting them to their precious capacity with community.
The anthropologists teach us that what we us, as human, as human, we always wanted the members of our community.
There is an evidence that in Olanda, 60 thousand years ago, they brought to the old trip of the old and the subjects with hurts, maybe because of the experience and survival of these people was the value of the community of the value of the community: they wouldn't see this people like a rare and value.
A few years ago, I was in a market of citizone where I grew up in that red area in the north of the Pennsylvania.
and I was in front of a hand in front of a podors.
And I was summer and I had a shorty pants.
I heard this guy, his voice, behind me and said, "Aimee Mullins." And I took me -- and there is this guy of half age. I didn't have any idea of who I wouldn't be who was.
And I said, "Do you let me meeting? I don't remember to me to have it met him to have met you haven't remember to have met you haven't remembered to have.
I mean, when we were met to you, when I was born with your mother."
GOh, that guy.
And, but of course, I was playing a field.
That means was the Dr. Kean, a man I had to be known with my mother, because of my mother on that day, because, clear -- because clear, typically, I came to retary.
And so, the kneecologist of my mother had gone in vacations, so the man who did me was a complex extractly for my parent.
And because I was born without the lost and I had a bad finger in this feet, and some of the finger, and some in that he had to be the bad messaggered messagger had to shap the bad news.
She said, "I had to give this one to your parents that you would never walked, and you never walked the kind of mobility that you'd never had the kind of mobility that have other children or no independent, and you gave me the good thing that have the other guyards of independent in my school in my childhood, which I said that he had taken me in my childhood, which I had won my childhood, which I had won my school,
that I had marched with the Girl Scout, you know, the Halloween, I had won my board, that I had won my scholarships, and use them -- entertained them and use them -- entertained by teaching the student of his medicine school of medicine school medicine school of medicine school, and Hershey.
And he called this part of the course of the X, the X, the potentiality of human volunteers.
You can have no progrid of how power can be and as a determining in the quality of a person.
And the Kean's Kean continued to explain me and said, "In my experience, unless you have been told repeated, and even though it is given a baby support, if it's left himself, a child come up with us -- a child come up."
You see, Dr. Kean has changed his opinion.
It has a difference between a medical condition, and what each one can do with it.
And there was a change in my thinking during the years, if you had 15 years old, if I had 15 years old, if I had 15 years, if I wouldn't have a second.
I was going to have that kind of normality at that time.
If you ask it today, I'm not sure.
And it's because of the experiences I had with them, not for the experiences I had with them.
And maybe, the change in me is happened because I was more to the people who opened me of those who opened me to the door of those who obstacouled.
You see, everything you need is a person that you show you the epiphysical of your potentiality of your potentiality, if you can give someone the key of their force, the human spirit is so rich, if you can do it and open a door for someone in a crucial moment.
You're teaching them to open the door open.
In fact, the significance of the word education is from the "education comes from the root to extract what it is, to bring out of the potential.
So again, what is the potential that we want to get out of it?
There was a case studio in the 1960 in the 1960 in Grand short schools.
This is called the "evidage," we call it the "aline" here in the United States.
It means separate students dependent on their voices.
And students with the best voices have a harder program, and they did it for a three months, and they did it for a three-months, and students with voices officer, they said, "optimos." The optimos," which were smart that were intelligent.
And at the end of this period of three months, were having a results of the optimos." And of course, the trister of this studio, and the trister of this studio, and they took students from "Oty" -- that's what happened at the end of the three months.
The ones that were standing to school, beyond to the ones I had left --
The critical part of this study was that even the teachers were winging.
The teachers didn't know that it was done this change.
She was simply saying: These are optime: These are the insufficient.
And so it's how they started teaching them.
So I believe that the real disability is to have a damage, and a damage, and a damaged no hope.
You can't see beauty.
It has no longer our natural children, and our innate ability to imagine.
if you aging, we can support the human spirit to maintaining the beauty in order to see the beauty of themselves, to be imaginative and curious curious, then we are using our strength correctment.
When the spirit has these quality, we can create new reality new ways of it.
I want to leave you with a poem poem from a 1300 called Hafiz who had 1,300 called Hafiz Jacques Dembois --
and the poem is called "Every children only four parole," "Every child -- "Every child -- not the God of NO, the God who only knows knows four four words and continued to repet, but the God that only knows four words and continued to ball with me.
Thank you.
