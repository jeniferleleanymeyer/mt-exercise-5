Sinchallenge, here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
Two people have to build the highest possible to build the highest possible that you can get up in the feet of a spaghects, a shadowmallow.
The marshmallow must be boned on the top to the top to the top of the top to the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top to the top of the top of the top to the top of the top to the top of the top of the tower.
And even though it looks very simple fact is pretty difficult, because people coustrate people to collaborate very quickly.
So I thought it was an interesting idea, and I sent it in a laboratory on the design of the design on the design of the design of it.
And it was a huge success.
And from then, I organized about 70 laborators of these kinds of these kind of design in this room around the world with students, designers and architects and development companies and development companies Fortune 50.
There's something in this exercise that you can see it importants about the nature of collaboration, and I want to share some of these lessons with you.
Normal, most people people beginning to originally the hand to the hand to be equic.
They talk to the bond would be expect that might be expect for power, and they go to planning the planning.
They make squarters and preavavails and preavavails
They have the most of the time is at the most of time at the end of the spaghi in the buildings, at the end of the time is to get a step and fall, somebody out the marshmallow, and fall, and fall, make a step back, and Ta-da!
They hit to be job.
But what happens is really, most of the times of the times is that the Ta-da-to-to-to-hmallow -- because the marshmallow weight to the sea weight of the sea structure.
There's a number of people that have many times "uh-o-oh-o-h-o-h-a-bo-h-ty-hy-hy-hy-hy-hy-hy-hype business of school.
They cheat, they wouldn't be awful and they create absolutely transballing.
And there are of course groups that have many more structure," and the best of the childhood schools of childhood.
And it's amazing.
It says Peter, not only create the highest structures, but they're also the most interesting structures.
And your questions will be like that? What is possible? What do they have to be particular it?
And Peter to say, "No of the guys time trying to become the SpA.SpA." Right.
They don't spend time competing for the power.
But there is another reasoning.
And the reason is that economy students are formed to find the single best project.
And then you can get it.
And after that, what happens is that when they put the marshmallow the top, they don't have longer time and what happens about it?
The crisis.
Do you sounds familiar it? Right.
What children do differently, is that they start from the marshmallow, and build prototypes, one after the other, and they have always different possibilities of advance to advance prototypes of advanced prototypes of balls long the ball.
The designers recognize that these kinds of collaboration is the essence of the process.
And with every version -- children have a feedback of what it works and what it doesn't work.
So the ability to work on prototypes, it's essential, but we see how different different work of groups.
The average for most people is about 50 centries, for economy, about 50 centries, for economy, about half of economy, about half a little better, but not much, a little better, better than many adults of adults.
Who does better than everybody else?
Architects and engineers, thank you at the sky.
99 cuts is the highest structure that I ever seen.
And why? Because they understand that triangles and the triangles and the models and the models are the key to build stable structures.
And then we have the general directors, a little better than the media.
But that's where it becomes interesting.
If you include a ride administrator of the delegation can do a lot better.
It's incredible. It goes to be a little bit around the wine that that group. You can see that that group. And why?
Because they have particular ability in agevolving ability to the work of the jobs.
They exist the process, I understood it.
And all the groups who gesturely and prestate attention to the work will be improved the result of the team.
Some Does and the dots of evolutation, and they combination bringing to a success.
If you have 10 groups that usually work, you know, maybe you're going to get structures that are in the feet.
And I tried to a interesting experiment experiment.
I thought, we got the wall, you know, you get a little bit of a time.
I put on the 10,000 dollars of premise in software in software incent.
What do you think about this happens to design?
What was the result of it?
Here's what happened.
None of the team has created a stable structure of the team has created a stable structure.
If one of them had built a 2.5 cent, it would have a 2.5 house to the premier.
Is it not interesting that a little bit of a impact so form it?
We tried to go back to the exercise with the same students.
What do you think about this happen?
Now they had the value of a prototype.
The same team, from the worst has become the best is the best of the best is the best of the best is the best one of the best is the best one of the best is the best one of the best is the best one of the best is the best one of the best is the best of the best is the best is the best of the best has become the best to the best one of the best is the best of the
They created the highest structure in the minute time.
So I'm important lessons about the nature of incentives and the successful could be wonder, why someone should spend time to write a marshmallow?
The reason is this: help to create digital instruments and processes to help build cars, video games and visual effects of visual effects of digital instruments and processes.
And what a marshmallow is to help identify to identify supposed to identify supposed to identify supposed to identify the nose.
Why, every project has his marshmallow, is not like that?
The challenge provide experience of shared a common language -- a common language -- a common position to build a prototype.
And so, this is the value of experience, of this simple exercise.
And those of you were interested in the marshmallowchallenge.com.
It's a blog where you can give a look at how marshmallow.
There are past him.
There are examples from all over the world about how people correct and sources the system.
There's also the record of the world.
And the most important, I think, is that design is really a sports of contact sport sports --
It requires the employments and the reasonably usuality of the most finally, the sensition and manuality to manuality the challenge that you have in the hand.
And some of the small prototype of this experience is all that is necessary to transform a "uh-h-o-h-hy-h-hy-hy-hy-hy-hy-hythy experience is all that is necessary to transform a "ta-h-h-o-h-hythy experience is all that it's necessary to transform a "ta-h-h-hyth-hyth-hyp
And that can actually make a difference.
Thank you very much.
We ended up having a machine, beautiful machine, in TEDstyle style -- it's a time.
All this room have to go there.
You can go back, you can go back, you can't go back.
And I would be curious to know what to choose is, because I asked my friends in the last few times, and everybody want to go back to the last few times, and everybody want to go back to
They don't know. They don't want to go back to the cars or Twitter, or "American Idol."
I don't know.
I'm convinced that there is a kind of return to our algies, illusions.
I understand.
But I don't do part of that group, I have to admit it.
I don't want to go back and go back, and because I don't want to go back to this planet not go back, go back to this planet not go back,
So I want to go into the machine, and I want to go on.
This is the best time that we can measurement, in every field that we can measures, health, mobility, checks, opportunities, hot, check of disease of disease of disease in a disease of disease of disease in the field of disease.
There was never a time like this.
My needs deeron, everyone of the 60 years.
My grandmothers spinated that number 70.
My parents are going to touch the 80s.
So it's better than my years at the beginning of my years at my death.
But it doesn't just about people like us, it's a much bigger than this.
A child born in New Delhi today can be expect to live as much the richest man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it. It's an amazing.
How do we be true?
Vaiole. The smallpox of people on this planet.
He has changed the demography of the global as no war has ever done it.
If you went to Svanite.
We sconfited.
In the rich world disease that were mining millions of people only a generation ago, they basic.
Teat, rosolia, poly; it was --
someone yet know?
Vaccine, modern medicine, our fall of our nutrients of scientific method.
And second me, the scientific method -- to try things and see if they work, to change when they don't work, is one of the great results of humanity.
These were the good news.
Unfortunately, they were the good news because there are other problems, and they were quote a lot of times -- and they were cked out of it, which we get away -- a billion people goes to read the fact that we get to the fed on this planet, every day.
This is growing with amazing rapidation, and it's vergognow.
And not only we used our creativity to filling the planet.
It takes a small point, groundable forests, oil rainforests, oil -- they're disappearing and they're disappearing and they're sparing out of this guair to pull out of this guair out of this guair out of this guy, we will disappearing even us.
So the question is, can we can we do that? I think yes.
I think it's clearly that it's possible to make food to feed billions of people without violent the earth that they live in.
I think it's possible to reform this world without that this energy world without that this is going to destroyed.
I think I really, and no, it's not a illusion pie.
But here's what I wake up with the night -- one of the things that keep me up with the night.
We never had to do as a scientific progress as we need now, but we never have been in the position of using them to use them to the better than we could use them today.
We're at a step from incredible events -- in many ambites.
But although this is we should go back centuries, 300 years before of the Illuminism, to find a time where we fighed the progression that we had to be a time when we got the more vigorous than we haven't been a vigorous way, than we do.
People are intriguing in what they believe, and they do it with a lot of them that we can't get it.
It turns out the truths to get it to freeze them.
About you all have right to their opinion; they also have right to the opinion; they also have to be right?
You don't have to say to your faces. I sorry absolutely wouldn't be there.
I put it a little bit to understand it.
A decade of years ago I wrote a story about vaccines for "The New Yorker," a short article.
And I was amazing someone opposed to what it is, after all, the most effective health of public health of all the most effective of all the human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I wrote the story and I wrote the story and went to other.
Not much later, I wrote a story about genetically food --
Same thing, just bigger bigger.
People were crazy.
So I wrote a story about that, and I couldn't understand why people were considered OGMMMs as "most," because they thought that we most," because they thought that we move the molecules in a specific, instead of nature.
But, as I do my job. I wrote the story and went for.
I mean, I'm a journalist: we send, we send, sends up there.
But these stories I could go and understand that I couldn't understand why, but at the end I did.
The problem was that those fanatics that were doing not fanatement fanatement.
They were consciousness, educated, people for well.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And what was was a lot of --
But then I thought, we have to be honest; we're at a point, on this planet, where we have no same relationship with progress that there was a time.
We talk about the environment.
We talk in ironic terms using the ironic virgolet: "Progres." Oh, well, there are motives to do it, and I think we know what they are.
We lost trust in institutions, in authority, and sometimes in science and it's understandable that it's happened.
You just do some names and people understanding it.
Chernobnob-ball, Challenger, Viox, Viox, the massive destruction of mass, elections.
I mean, each one has his list.
We have questions and problems with people that we thought we were right.
So you're skeptical skeptics.
You have a question, you pretend to pretend to provide it.
You don't give anything for granted.
But here's the foundation is to get to accept them get to accept them and we're not very good at this.
And I think that the reason that we have in a fear epidemic of fear that I never saw and hope I never saw and I hope I can't see it.
About 12 years ago was published a story, a horrible story, which support was a bond between a drim and the bucket and the bucket and rosolia.
Very scary.
Hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true.
And they had to do hundreds of studies; it's a important.
They came up with the data.
They came from the U.S., from the Sweden of Sweden from the Canada, and everyone was equal, no correlationship, no correlationship, no correlationship, no correlationship, no correlationship, no correlationship, no correlationship, no correlationship, no correlationship, no crows from the Sweden, from the Swedwo, and
It doesn't make difference. It didn't make it because we believe the aneddoes, to what we see -- to what we see -- to what we think we can see -- what it makes us feel real --
We don't believe a folding documents of the government that are exactly by the government that show us all the time.
But you know what?
The results have been devastated.
because that's a fact that this is a fact: The U.S. is one of the population in which the number of vaccines against death is caling more.
It's horrible, and we should be vergognarrowing.
It's terrible.
What happened that happened that it is to do something like that?
Now, I understand it. I understand it. I understand it.
Think about it, someone here has the dead?
Somebody in the audience has ever seen a person die of death?
It doesn't happen to be happen.
In this country doesn't happen, but this happened 160,000 times in the world last year.
I'm a little bit of deaths for death; 20 every hour.
But since it doesn't happened here, we can take it from the head and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around to shoot messages and palcoscenic messages like Oprah or ignorance from palcoscenic or Larry King Lie.
And they can do because they don't understand the difference between causality and correlationship.
They don't understand that these two things seem like equal, but they're not almost mayor.
But it's something we have to learn it and learn it quickly.
This man was a hero, Jonas Salk.
He has free the humanity from one of his floaggs.
No suffering no suffering -- the polyo, puff, and it can -- disappear.
The man at the middle at the middle of the middle.
It's called Paul Offit.
It just created a vaccine against the rotable together, with other people.
He saved 400, life of 400, 5,000 children every year in the developing countries.
Do you get bad to it?
It's good, if it wasn't that Paul goes around to talk about vaccines, says how precious and people should just stop frignate.
And it says in these terms of this.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul talks to a public handle can't test testimonies without a armate.
They call it home because to some please remember them who know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul has created a vaccine.
I wouldn't need to tell you, but vaccines are fundamental.
If we smooth to get the disease return to come back and he's going to be awful disease, and it's going on.
We have the new morning.
And it's going to be worse and worse not very children will begin to die against numbers.
And they won't die at the death.
Can policy? Are that it is. Why not?
My college of college on his college wrote a couple of weeks ago, and he said that was considered a little bit of it.
Nobody had said before.
She wouldn't have to be wouldn't walk against the polyo.
It nearly dead.
OK.
Why? Because there's no polio from us. But you know what?
We didn't have the poly in the United States.
And I don't know. I -- maybe a guy is salized on a plane in Laaake and it's coming to Laaake and it's coming to L.A.
Maybe it will land in a couple of hours, will nothing a car, will be in the Long Beach and staser stasy of one of these fantastic cenvironmental cenvironment of these fantastic organized cenvironmental cenvironmental cenvironmental cengineered by a TED.
He doesn't know that it was infected by a paralyzen paralyzing -- and we don't know because it's so that it works the world.
This is the planet we live in. We don't do it as well as well as well.
We don't don't even beyond us good about it. We're doing it.
All of you have tains stammorning?
Echinacea, a little antiossidants to start the day.
I know you did because the Americans of Americans do it every day.
They take that stuff, as they deal with alternative medicine and not matter how we often demostrate that are unuseful.
The data shows seeds.
They get the best urine. More than this is not a doing, almost mays.
But it's good, you want to spend 28 billion dollars for school, it's with you.
Urina-school. Scoure.
Why do we do that?
I think we can understand it, we oh the great drugs.
We don't really get the great government machine -- we don't figure it.
And we do good. Our health system is going to do it.
It's cruel to millions of people.
It's absolutely incredibly cold, and demoralizing for those of us that can afford it.
So we can we get far away away from who?
We skills in the great placebo.
It's great. We love the great placebo.
You know, it's a night problem because this stuff is a schip, and we spend billion dollars.
I have a whole series of examples.
Nobody with these -- a from, a hacechinkgo -- a from, awful -- I don't even know what it is but we spend billions of dollars, and it's a from.
You know what? When I say these things, people are going to reach them, and they say, "But what is interested in you?
It's going to be good."
You know, you walk back? You walk back.
Because I don't interested in if it's the secretary of the Department for Salute and the Umani Umani Umani to say, "Uhm, I don't have to hear the evidence of the mammography or if it says it says it says it some longer than the patients that wants to coffee the patients with climbs at the coffee of the coffee of the care of the crush.
When we embitches the street that leads to replace science and evidence and evidence and translation, we end up in a place where we wouldn't be there.
We start like Thabo Mbeki Mbeki in South Africa.
It killed 400 measures continuing to say that slows and squarter-re-re-re-retroviral drugs and the limone that we know can slow the decord.
Hundreds of thousands of deaths in a country that has been slower than every other from this disease in this disease of disease.
Please, you don't get to tell me that there are no consequences for these actions.
There are seeds. There are seeing.
Now, the largest epidemic epidemic is now the war between the support of the genetically modified and the elites.
It's a idiatriba. It has to end up there.
It's a diatriba, on the metaphors.
It's ideology, it's not science.
Every single thing we eat every single of rise, every chick of rise, every left of the Bruxelles was modified by man.
You see, there were no dribind of Eden.
There were no melans.
There were not even Natal trees. We created Natal trees.
We did it in the last 11111-year-old year-old year-old year-old year-old year-old year-old --
Something worked and something else now.
And we eliminated what it wasn't going to work.
Now we can do it in a way.
And there are risks, of course, that there are some of the risks,
But we can put things like living in the rise, and this would help millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, and millions of people, and millions of people,
And we don't want to do it?
I have to say that I don't understand it.
We have against OGM.
Why?
The things that I feel soon: we too many chemicides, pesticides, monoculture, we don't want to be amazing in the same thing, it's wrong.
We don't want that companies to put patent on life.
We don't want that companies are uniques in the seeds.
You know what my answer to this?
That's right. We're right. Let's do something.
It's true, we have a huge food problem but it's not science.
It doesn't have anything to do with science.
It's read, morality, he line drives on shorts.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes it as a positive results -- but the idea that we should not afford to do its science to do because we have fear to prosper.
You know, in the next 50 years we will be forced to produce 70 percent of what we produce now, 70 percent of what we produce now, 70 percent.
These are the investments in Africa in the last 30 years.
Vergo.
They need to be not diam.
Why? Cibo genetically modified up.
We don't want to encourage people to eat squarters like manioca.
I smooth billion people eat.
It looks a little bit like a little bit.
But it only provide calories.
It doesn't have no nutrients, it doesn't have proteins, but scientists are being settled in this moment.
So many people could eat less and run the risk of becoming sky.
They wouldn't die and you know what?
It would be very beautiful. It wouldn't be a restory would be very beautiful.
I can we have solut: why are we countered it?
I mean, do we ask the ocean: why are we stacking this thing?
Only why don't we want to move genes and therefore there.
It's about genes.
It's not about our redial-hossession for ormon, or of our wish to have bigger much better food.
They don't get the Rice Krispies.
This is about saving people, and it would be that we begin to understand what it means to say.
Why -- you want to know about it, and we keep behavioring it to behavior, we will be a lot of something that we don't think we want to be something that we don't think we want to macchiar the technological colonialism technological colonialism technological colonialism --
There is no other way to describe what is going on.
It's egoist, it's horrible, it's horrible, and we have to stop it.
So, after this funny conversation of fun, you might say, "You still want to ask myself, "Would you still want to go to this ridiculous time and go to the future?"
Okay, of course.
It's blocked on the present now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can impose the machines of time as we want.
We have the possibility to go where we want, and we really want to go where we want.
We have to do these conversations, and we have to think about it, but when we go into the machine and we are going to be happy to do it.
I know we can -- I know how to think that the world needs to it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
A day, the cronist of Los Angeles Times Steve Lopez was passecting on the streets of Los Angeles when he wrote a beautiful music of the Man.
He was from a man -- a man Afro-American Afro-American Afro-American actors, without dimore, and without diage, who was a violin that he had only two cores.
I'm telling a story that many of you know -- because the Steve articles of Steve Look in the cstanding of a book -- that was in the great screen, and the great screen, with Robert Downew, with Robert Downeed, and Jamie Fox, and Jamie Fox, and Jamie Foxie in the Nathony of the schievement, the contrably in that was international by the schievement of the schief of the schief of which was international schievement of the schievement squicelips that was inter.
Nathaniel let me left Juilliard, he had a terrible nervous exauthor, and 30 years later lived as a without the streets of the Skid Row in the middle of Los Angeles.
I mean, all of you to read the Steve book to look at the movie to understand not just the beautiful legal that created between these two men,
I call Jane McGonigal. I'm a video games.
I realize games from 10 years and my objective for the next 10 years is trying to save the next 10 years, is to try to save the world in real life.
To do it a story and convincing more people who I understood everybody to play more people who was to play more beautiful than to play and interesting.
We go through the moment we go through three billion hours playing online.
Some of you might think, "It's a lot of time spent to play it."
maybe too time, considering how many of urgent problems we have to solve in the real world.
In fact, second my research research that I was in the Futuro, actually is true the contrary.
Too billions of hours are not minimally enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world.
In fact, I think if we want to survive the next century of this planet we have to increase that digm we have to increase that digned.
I calculated that the total that we need is 21 billion hours of play every week.
It's probably an idea a control of the intuitive idea of it, so the repet, so we can reach the concept.
If we want to solve problems that fame, the climate change, the climate change, the obesity, the obesity, the obesity, I believe we have to have the environment, for the 21 billion hours a webk, for the next decadecade. No, are serious. No, they're serious.
This is why. This picture is because I think that it's so important to play is so important for the survival of the human species. It true.
This is a photographer of the photographer Phil Toldan, he wanted to capture the play emotion.
So he pictures of the players while they players players like they players walking.
And this is a classic of playful game.
If you don't use used to be players that you losed some of the sfumure of this picture.
You probably notice the sense of urgence, a little bit of fear, but also a very profound concentration, a very deep attention to deal with a very difficult problem.
If you are used to no-habital players around the eyes are a few details, and around the mouth are a sign of optimism.
And it turns out the slides show up.
This is a habital player from a step called "Epicaw."
Ah, it's a term that you heard of it. OK. Okay. Okay. OK.
So we have used to do habital players between us.
A living vittoria living result so extraordinary positive that doesn't seem to you can get until you can get it.
It's almost beyond the slide of the imagination, and when you get a shock discovering what you're really skill.
This player is at a epical player is a epical player is a epical player is at a epical player is at a epic.
And this is the expression we need to see on the fact that we need to see on the world of the world as we face the obstacles of the next hundred years.m. And the expression of someone who, against all the expression of someone who, against the epic expression of someone that epic expression of somebody which, I think about all the expression of somebody who, and it's at a epic expression of someone who, against all the expectation of someone that we have to see on the fact of the extor of the expectest extremact
Unfortunately, this is the expression that we see in the life of all the day-while we face to deal problems.
This is the expression we call "Brate Nella Realty. And I'm going to do it.
I'm with the expression "I'm not Bravail.
This is a graffer in my old Berkeley, in California, where I did the PhD on the because we're more good in the game that in real life.
And this is a lot of many abit: we feel that we don't really good at the reality of the games.
And I don't mean "good good bads," even if the success is going on is -- even though the success of the online.
But I mean "good good at the sense of motivated to do something important, inspired to collaborate and cooperate.
And when we are in a wonline world I think many of us become the best versions of themselves, the most capacity to help without prevent on a problem for the whole time to be newspaper, and try to get up after a failure and try new new thing.
And in real life, when we face a failure, when we face a obstacular of it, we often not feel like that we feel like that we feel anxious, maybe depressed, maybe depressed or Chinic.
We never try to do this feelings while play, just not there in a game.
So that's what I wanted to study to university.
What is in a game is that in a game that we can't get any results that we can't get any results of the results of the results of that we can't get any result that we can't get any results that we can't get any results that we can't get any results that we can't get any result that we can't get any result of it.
How can we transport those feelings and applying them to the real?
So I studied with games like World of Warcraft, which is really the ideal environment to solve problems in collaborative maniery.
And I started to notice some things that make the epic lives so possible in online.
The first is, when you open up in one of these games online, especially in World of Warcraft, there are many different characters that flower to save the point that you have a mission to save the world.
But not a mission, any mission: a perfectly mission, perfectly adequate in the game. Right?
So you can complete.
They never give you a challenge challenge slip.
But it's at the limits, so you have to try seriously.
But there is no disoccupation in World of Warcraft, you can't go to throw the pollics, there's always something specifically and important to do.
And there are many collaborators.
So you go to hundreds of thousands of people, practice to you get to your epical mission.
It's not something that is so common in real life, this feeling that we have lots of collaborators.
And there's this narrative epic, this narrative that inspirative that is there, and what we're doing.
And then we remember all this positive feedback positive --
You've heard of the level and a force, and a major intelligence --
We don't receive that kind of constants in real life.
When I leave this stage of a Please not have a path in the audience, and a pleasure of a piece of bizarre --
I didn't get that kind of real-life feedback in real life.
Now, the problem of collaborative online like World of Warcraft is that it gives so much satisfaction is that it gives to a living from a liver life, and the whole moments, that we decide to spend all our time in these games.
It's just better than reality.
This is that that, finor, collectively all the World of Warcraft have spent 5.93 million years to solve the virtual problems of Azeroth.
This is not necessarily thing negative.
But put it in perspective -- 5.93 million years ago was the time when one of our ancestors had been topped up in the planet in the plan.
That was the first one walking walking her.
OK, so when we talk about how long time we're investing in play, the only manier-sensory manier-sensory of talking about the day-to-to--- but also useful thing -- but also useful, because we found that we have discovered that we're changing what we're changing about how we can be human evolved to collaborate more and have more heartor more heart.
This is true, I believe.
So you know this statistics.
It was published recently by a Carnagie Mellon.
The young medium today in a country with a strong culture of a country with a strong of the top of 10,000 hours playing online, at the age of 21 years.
10,000 hours is a very interesting number of two reasons.
First of all, for the children in the U.S. 10.080 hours is the exactly exactly that the maurity if you're present all day.
So we have a whole whole parallel of education in which young people learn how to be a good good good ble-player-ty-short time to school what they learn the whole thing.
And some of you have probably read the new Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuoriclasse."
If you have read this theory of successful theory of successful theory for successful success.
It's based on a good research in the cognison, which is that if we dedict that if we dedict 10,000 hours of study fruited at a 21 years of genes in that field.
We're good at that something as much the best people in the world.
So, what we have now now now is a whole generation of young people who are the genes of the game.
So the question is, "Exattly, what become bad bad these gate?"
because if we could understand what this is we would have a human-resource of human resources without previous extent.
This is the number of people in the world that are at least one day to play online.
These are our game genes of the game.
500 million people who are extraordinary, very bad -- in something.
And in the next decade we have another billion of habital players that are extraordinary.
If you didn't know it, this is what expect us to expect us -- the video games is developing platforms that consumes power and work with the cell phone that will work with the Internet in India, particular bank you instead of the world around the world, in India, China, Brazil -- they can connect online.
The estimate is a billion players in the next decade.
This will take us 1.5 billion players.
So I started thinking about what these games are transforming us into genes.
These are four expects I have individuals. The first is a very good urgent of it.
Okay. Think it as a extreme of self-motivation.
A optimism is the desire to be to acting immediately to face a obstacular with the convinction of having a reasonable reasonable to have a reasonable reason for success.
The abitual players believe that a living lives is possible and that it always has a living and worth of prove it, and try and now try and now try and now.
The abitual players are not with the hands in hands.
The abitual players are virtuous virtuous with a social trama social trame.
There are many interesting research that show how we find better with other people after played with other people after played with them, even though they had been playing with themselves.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust, to play with someone -- we trust that will be going to be able to play with the same rules and obbirds and with the same rules and obbirds and the same obbirds and the same obbig.
So, to play together with builds the bonds of the cooperation and cooperation of cooperation.
And the result we really have a lot more robust social relationships.
Just to love game. Tewish address
You know, there's a reason that the World Warcraft player 22 hours a week, almost as a part-labor work.
It's because we know while we're playing -- that we actually play, and more happy working on it and more happy than we can sleep us and lost time.
We know that we're optimized, as a human being, to work on a lot of things that has meaned.
And used to work on the habital players are dispoundly in constantly, if it's a adapt-task --
Finally, a epic means.
The habital players adoring to be associated with wonderful human stories on the planetary scale of planetary scale of planetary carian scale of planetary climbers.
For example, a little information to help create a context.
You know Wikipedia, the biggest wiki in the world.
The second wiki biggest wiki in the world, with almost 80,000 articles is World of Warcraft China, million people use it every month.
They have skilled more information on World of Warcraft in the Internet, which is any other argument in any other wiki in any other wiki in the world.
They're building a epicture of it.
They're building a source of information source in World Warcraft.
OK, these are the four superpowers that together together something alone thing.
Arainable players are individuals of great optimism of super-powers.
These are people who believe that they are individually skills to change the world.
The only problem is that believe that they are able to change the virtual worlds but not real that real one.
This is the problem I'm trying to solve.
There's a economy of Edward Castronova.
His a studies are brilliants. It's studying why people invested so much time, energy and money, in online.
He says, "We are looking at what it is nothing that is nothing that a mass exodd exodd to the world's game and the environments and the honline."
And it's a economy, so it's rational and says -- -- not like me, I'm a player project -- I'm exuberant.
But he says -- he says this is a perfectly sensory, because the used players can get more in the world's world's players in real life.
They can have more solid social relationships in a game that doesn't be in real life.
They have a better feedback and feel more feeling feeling in a game that doesn't in real life.
So, I saw now, it's perfectly reasonable to now, it's perfectly reasonable players in the real world that in the real world that this is reasonable to agree that this is reasonable to now but not, in a way, a situation of the world that we have to start to make the world more similar game. We have to start the real world than a game.
Here's a tragge from something that happened 2500 years ago.
These are days of ancient hossswings, and we had a joysticks and and blew bons and blew wonderful challenge of sheep and the first instruments of humanity.
If you know the ancient of the rest of the gree story.
It's the story of who invented games and because.
I was born that plays, particularly the games of the game of the fooks of the Lidia, during a period of the Lidia, during a period of a caresty.
It was so several that the pieces of Lidia decided to do something impensible.
People suffering, the population was in the extreal, it was a situation of extrema.
So, second Erodot, they invented the game of the days and emanded a valid law for all right.
Somebody would eat all.
The next day everybody would have play -- everybody would have played it.
And they dive to deeply the game of the game is so involved and that is so involved and productivity, and it dives us in a game, that ignored the fact of not eat.
And so one day they playing, and a day they eat a day.
And second Erodot, they sweet so 18 years, surviving a day and playing the following a day and playing the follow.
I think that's exactly the way we use today.
We use games to get to sleep to get to the real world of the real world.
We use games for the game of everything that doesn't work in our real environmental life, from everything that doesn't work in our real life, and get what we need from the games.
But we don't have to stop here.
This is decided, Erodot, second Erodot, after 18 years, the caresty was not to talk to the best walking a last wall.
They were beginning to the whole realm to the way a fabulous game women in that participate to participate a favorite adventure to a epia.
They let up the Lidia and went to a new land and to go to a new land where to live, leave the number of people to survive with the resources of people to survive with the resources of their civilization somewhere, where else could have their civilization somewhere, where you could have the other hand, where you could prosper.
It's a little idea idea of weird it, right?
But it turns out of the DNA have revealed that the Etrusks that would have been brought to the roman, shared the same DNA of the Lidia.
So the recently scientists have suggest that the story of Erodote is a real story.
And geologists have found evidence of a global raffee that it almost 20 years and that could explain the caresty.
So this amazing story might be true: they could have saved their culture playing, refugee in the games for 18 years to be so inspire how to come to save so well as well as well as well as the entire civilization to save so the civilization.
Okay, we can do it even well.
We are at World of Warcraft from 1994.
It was the first ones of strategy in real time of the World Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
They played by 18 years, we played Warcraft for 16 years.
I say -- we're ready for our epic game for our epic game --
They would work out half of the population of a new world.
It's where I tragge the idea of 21 billion hours of play a week.
We do half of us to agree that half of us to play a day to play the day to play the problems of the real world.
Imagine what you're going to ask, "How do we do to solve the problems in a game?" Well, this is what I said to be in a game?" Well, what I said my work on the last years, I have to be the Istitute for Fur Fur uro.
In our Palo Alto we have this stendarying our idea that we should be relationship to how we should relate to the future.
We don't want to predict the future.
What we want to do is to be to realize, the future.
We want to imagine the scenaries from the best results and then we want to give people to transform them in concrete it.
We want to imagine lives to make epic epic epic to make them.
I'm going to show you three games that I realized and I'm a attempt to give people the instruments to create of epic lives in their future.
This is "Mondwisdo."
We did this game in 2007.
It's a online play in which you look at a load of oil to survive a card-oil carefull-hy-like oil care.
The charge is not real life -- but we published sufficient on to make life that it is, and to make life as a little bit of the things like we were at the section, and you have to make you news -- you know, you compared to you, you know, you compared to you, you can be a video data that show exactly the cost of the oil distribution. The things that are not available to be available to the food distribution.
If there are impacts on transportation, if the schools are closed and you have to think about how you live your life if this was real. And you have to say you have a blog on a blog on a blog on a shot of a blog --
We had this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we looked at them for the three years old, and what I can say is that transform.
Nobody wants to change the manier manier in which lives because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a shouldn't do it.
But if you dive them in a epic adventure and says, "We've got no longer oil and says, "We've got no longer oil and says, "We've got no longer oil adventure them in a ept adventure and says, "We've got no longer oil adventure and says, "We've got no oil oil and says, "We've got no longer oil and says, "We have no longer oil and says, "We don't have oil oil in a well.
This is an amazing.
It suntil you see how to survive."
Most of our players who learned in the games that learned in the game.
So, for the next to save the world, we decided to save the world, we decided to put higher more than oil than oil in the careful problem of oil carefully care.
We did a game called Superperstruct, at the Istitute for Futuro, and the premise was. a supercomputer has calculated that humanity has only other 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputer was called "The Global of Allerte Estination of the Global Estination of the Global Estination.
We asked people to reach online almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer's film in a Jerry Bruckheimer's film walking away in a Jerry Bruckheimer's film walking along as in a Jerry Bruckheimer's film walking online in a Jerry Bruckheimer's movie online film like in a Jerry Bruckheimer's movie online --
You know Jerry Bruckheimer's films of a dream, I have a dream, and scientist, the astronauta, scientist, and everybody else to save the world, but in our game, but in our game, instead of having a five people in the squarter, and it's all the wall, and it's all the wall, and it's a dream, and it's the future of the future of the security and the future of security and the future of the security and the future of the future of security and the future and the future of the future of security and the future and the future and the future and the future and the future and the future and the future and the future and the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the fut
They played eight weeks to eight weeks have been given to 500 solutions that you can find if you go online and look at Google "Superpert."
Finally, the last game, the last three of marze. This is a three of marze. This is a further played with the Istitute of the World Bank.
If I completely play the game of the World Bank, like the Social Innovater Bank, like Social Innovater Class in 2010.
Lavoring with universities shot for sub-Saharan Africa, we're inviting them to learn the social innovation techniques.
There's a story of fumet, you increases in level of ability as a local knowledge of local knowledge and the inventia.
To invite all of you to share this guy with young people, wherever in the world, particularly in the developing areas of the developing areas of the developing of the world that they could benefit to save the world of their social imprecise to save the world.
It's now to conclude it.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think about going to happen that?
We have all of these amazing games that are a piloses of what we might be able to do that, but no one of these game projects saved the real world.
Well, I hope that you agree with me that I agresource that we can use to make a human resource that we can use to make some of the real-world that players are a powerful platform for the change, that we have these incredible superpowerful properties of that we have these incredible superpowerful resource of a epic meaning epic means.
I really hope that we can come to play play that we can get us to play on this planet for another century, and my hope is that you join me to you in the realize and participate and participate how these guys are going to be like this.
When I look at the next decade, two things are certainly, two things are certain -- we can do anything we can imagine, and we can play anything we want to play anywhere we want to play anywhere we want to play anywhere we want to play anywhere we want to play anywhere we want to play to it.
So, I say -- we let's do the play that will change the world.
Thank you.
For some time I was interested in placebo, it can look like a strange thing that a magician effect of it, unless you consider that you don't think you look at the point of the points of the way to become something reality in other words, the pills of sugars -- the pills of sugars effect in some studies, the effect of some studies, the person thinks
which is happening is to have to be a drug or something like --
The pain of pain, for example, if they believe that we have a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect.
Something is true for perception that if you have it.
So to understand that you have to show you a magic trick very simple magic very simple magic trick.
And I'll show you how it works. This is a trick that is present in all the books for children in the field of the years.
I learned from only with Cub Sco-Magic Scout Magic in the 19setting.
And so I'll execran it for you and so I'll explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I explained it.
Here's what happens.
The color, you can examinate; my hand you can examine.
I'm just going to take the coldly in my pug, like this.
I was up on the hand.
To be safe that nothing is or saving from my hand.
Now weird my poly-like this.
So you can see that something can go through the way of the way you can go on or down or down from my hand.
And the purpose of that is simple.
I go to open my hand and if everything has gone walked up my magnetism is going to be the cold.
And in fact, it remains so I can hear that I can school it doesn't fall the colds.
Nothing goes on or down from my hand.
You can see any trick. You can examine anything.
Ta-da!
This is a trick that often intuitor to the children.
that are interested in the magic because you can learn a lot about the ingage of the ingage of the ingage of this also if you put it in a lot of simple.
Many of you in this room will know this trick.
Here's what I think is what I want to be the colds.
I say that I saw my wright.
to make sure that save swimming or scenes from my handwide -- this is a good thing.
The reason why I'm tending the pole is because it's the secret of illusion.
In the moment when my hand moves away from you, this fingtandoses here, my indeed, he shoulder, in a position.
There's someone who has not had a childhood.
That's from here, from here, right.
And when I also go around the finger is moving away.
We can talk about why it's sunning, because you don't notice that there are only three fingers down because the mind, and the way with which is information not contain, one, two, three.
But it's not the point. Right? And when I open my hand, Of course it was not through the animal magnetism, by the souldn't through the souldn't with my index here.
And when I close my finger, I same thing, when I walk back, this movement to the finger that comes back to it.
It turns out it away away.
It's a trick you can do with your friends and close. Thank you.
Now, what is to do with the placebo?
I read a study, a year ago, a year ago, which has pushed me to mind.
I'm not a medical researcher, for which was a surprising.
It looks like that if you look at a placebo in the form of a white pill, made like a white aspill, just a white pill, a white pill, white a crazy pill, it has a measurable effect.
But if you change the shape and you give the placebo, under the form of a smaller pill, and blue printed a literally more effective.
Even if no one of the two has any drug -- they're crawls of sugar.
But a white pill, it's not like a blue pill.
You know, it really unconict.
But by the way, it's not here that it goes up.
The capsule of the pastern of every form.
A capsule of the colored one hair, which is a resist of a capsule capsule.
The dosage has a role-hype.
One of the couple two a day is not as effective like three pills. Now I don't remember the statistics.
But the point is,
-- that these dosages have a role-up.
And it also has a role-like a role.
And if you want the definitely defining placebo you have to use a ago.
Right? A siringe with something -- a couple of a couple of a inert of an inert of a inert of a couple of a inert of a couple of a couple of a couple of cs.
You start it in a patient --
This is a strong picture so strong in their mind, much strong than the white pill.
It's real, this graphics -- I'm going to show you another time when we have slides.
The white is not the white pillle is not effective as the one that blue is not as an ago.
And no one of these has a drug-quality quality.
It's just your believing that makes them in your cover, and raphforce the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply to a magic trick for a magic trick.
And do something that is a trick and do it seems to be real.
And we know from that study when you want to use the ago.
This is a seven ininches of seven inches.
The sterilist a little bit.
This is my meat. This is not a special Carne special Carne of Damian.
This is my skin. This is not a special hollywood.
I'm going to bucket my skin, and to go this ago to the oppoint.
If you try to get nauseful -- if you get easily -- I did for some friends in the trego, the other night and a woman is almost unknown, and a woman is almost unslame.
So if you try nauseful easy that you don't look at the next 30s -- in fact, I'll be that you don't look for the next 30.
You can see, you can see from another part.
Here's what happens, the beginning of my arm at the lowest part of my arm at my arm just just a little bully.
Do you use it?
And now a little through my skin, and out of the other hand, like this.
Now, we're in the same position that we were with the knife.
More or less or less of the fingers now, now?
So you have the most. Here's one two, three, five --
I know what people looks when you see that I know.
They think they say, "Oically, it's not going to be stupid to buck up with a few minutes of them to be a few minutes.
So, let me give you a swalking up a swall.
How would you see? Abur right.
Yeah, I know that there will behind "Okay, I don't seen it well."
People in the saccan.
Let me show you close to show it close.
This is really my skin. It's not a special effect of Hollywood.
This is my carne, and I can turn it around it.
You know, if you feel bad about another part, you look at another part, you don't look at it.
People in the bottom or will say, "Well, it's clear, it's clearly that it was clearly that it was true, but if it was true --
You see there's a hole here and a hole here, if it was true blood here, if it was true blood --
Well, I do out a little blood for you.
Here's here.
I don't want to let the ago.
I would like my arm, and I would like to see that there are not hurt there.
But I think in this context and the idea of taking something fake and turn it into something that I will let it to be in a little bit of the stage.
We're going to see different in the next day. I hope you can't see the now. Thank you very much.
So, in my life I met a lot of fish.
I just loved them two of them.
The first one of a passional story.
It was a beautiful fish sets, a best weigh, a slides on the menu.
What a weight!
What even better than the best of the furniture of the sandard of the most of environmental standard of environmental standard.
So, you feel like to be a place with consciousness to sell it.
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for different months.
A day, the head of company called me and asked me to talk about a dedicated event of the environmental sustainability of the training.
"Of course I said, "Oh, of course.
This was a company that he was trying to solve what was to solve what has become an unimaginable problem for our chef.
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu?
In the last 50 years we have fished in the same way we have a sentences in the same way we have the soil forests.
The destruction was tremendous about it.
90 percent of the great fish, the ones that we like so much tonn, the halibut, the halibut, the sunlides, the slides are drastically reduced number of number of number of number of of number of number of numbers.
There is almost nothing about it.
So, we like to be or less water or less water of the fish, it will become part of our future.
There are a lot of arguments.
The cuts of the fish, for the least most of the most of them -- and they're inefficient. You take the ton for example.
A great problem is that there is a food of a 15 to one.
This means that it means that it takes 15 swild fish to get a book of the tonnail.
It's not very sustainable.
And the knowledge is not a great cheap and challenge.
So here was here here here was a company that was trying to do it in the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The first one of the event I telephone car of the public public relationships.
Let's call it Don.
"Don," I said, "How much to understand well, you are famous to do so far away to get away in the away that doesn't pollut."
"Exact," he said we are so far from the coast of our shot that our shot is diluits, not concentration."
And then added "We're basically a world at the particular world at all."
"The conversion of conversion? 2.5 to a hoo."
"The best in the sector."
2.5 to one, fantastic.
"2.5 to one thing? What do you give you to the fish?"
"Tine sustainable Protein say.
"Great," I said, "Look yo.
The night, I was at night, I thought, I think, but it slide is a sustainable protein it?
So the next day I was first of the event, I called Don.
I said, "Don, do you have some examples of sustainable protein s?"
He said I didn't know. And he said that he would be asked around around here.
Well, I talked to a little bit about the company and no one seppes to give me a answer that is precise.
And until I spoke to the biologist biologist --
We also call it Don.
"Don," I said, "Do you have some examples of sustainable protein s?"
Well, he mentioned some algae and some algae and then said, "People of the pollo."
I said, "People thor?"
He said, "Yeah, thought, sand slightly swears, sliced and spared to eat and processed to eat s."
I said, "What about your percentage of your eat is made of pollo?"
I think, say, the two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent."
I said, "Don: What is that sustainable in the fishing of the pollen to the fishing?"
There was a long pauses on telephone and then said, "There are too many pollen in the world."
I sweaving this fish.
No, because I'm not one of those virtuoes of the good food and traditional food and traditional food and traditional --
Well, to say that truth. I are.
No, in fact, I disamong this fish because, I want to do it after that conversation, the fish knew -- the fish knew --
The second fish is a different love story.
It's a story that is a story that the most knowledges and more him.
I eat it for the first time in a restaurant, in the south of Spaper.
My friend of my journalist had talked about this fish.
She was going to have met us to meet it.
He came to the table had a brilliant white color, almost swing white color,
The chef had to be too much.
Spindouble of how it should be cotted.
It was very unbelievable.
Who is able to make a good fish so good after having it a way after the street of them up?
I mean, but this guy yes.
We call Miguel.
It is actually called Miguel.
No, it didn't have the fish, and it's not a cheap.
For the less, not in the sense that we mean by it.
It's a biologist in Veta biologist of the fiur in the corner of the Spain to the Spain to the Spain to the Spain to the Spain of the riuge of the riume of the riume of the river.
As the '80 the early 80 the earth of the argues.
They had become on what before was essentially was a paludox zone swoods.
They had given the earth building a series of convolving with a bunch of canal dog in the river.
Well, they can't make it works like what not from the economic point of view.
And from the ecologic view of it was a disaster.
He had killed something like 90 percent of the birds and water the place, it's a lot of bird birds --
So in 1982 a spagno-like company with a consciousness comfortable company, he bought the earthquake of the ground.
What do they do?
They can invert the flow of water.
Letterally, they invert the switches of the switches.
Instead of convolved water from the ground to use the channels to inonward.
They all start all the chanals.
They realized a 27 miles of fishing out of 27 miles of the spigs, rangers and in this process, Miguel and this company and this company and this company -- the ecologic destruction of the ecologic destruction of the ecologic destruction of the ecological distruction.
The farming is incredible.
I mean, you never saw a thing like this.
Look at the horizon that looks like a million miles and everything that you see are the inones and all that you see are the inonlages and this recognize --
I was there little time ago with Miguel.
It's an amazing three quarter quarter Charts Darwin and a quarter Crocode Dundee.
Okay? We're made in the middle to this lague, I had the fanger and I had the game to the knea's knea's lesson of biology.
First of a white Norbic.
And then it explain the fitos of the fitoplankton and fish swim that remember the gyraffe that reminds the Tanzania.
It turns out out that Miguel has spent a lot of his career in Africa.
I asked them how it was a fish.
He said, "You know, do I don't know anything fish.
I'm a relationship in relationship."
And he was going to launches up still on the rare along and plants and plants.
It wasn't well well all this was very fascinating, which is -- that as biotic community.
It's interesting, but I was in love with the way, I was in love with it.
And my head was continuing to think about that deliptious fish, I had the previous night.
So the interrupts and I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish so good fish so good fish so good fish it?"
He indicated the algae indicated the algae and he indicated the algae.
"I know, the algae, the fitoplankton -- the relationships, yes, it's incredible.
But your fish what are eating with that?
What is your food rate conversion of food conversion of food conversion s?
Well, it answers to me how they would be a rich system so rich that the fish eat exactly what they would send in a selfish.
The biomass of plants, the stoplankton -- that's all of the fish.
The system is so in health that you have completely recognize that it was completely unnoid.
There are no eat.
You ever heard of a farming that doesn't give to eat his animals?
More later, I was driving around the earth with Miguel and I said, "In a place like this looks like like this is so natural so that it seems so natural that has ever seen as a concept that has ever seen to measure?"
In that moment, was like if the register of a movie had a film had the change of the set.
We went the corner and we saw a scene between the most incredible thousands and thousands and thousands of phencopters of the rocket that lost of eye.
"That's the success," he said, "That's successful successful -- he said, "That's the successful successful.
"Look their bons are red one.
They're bank you.
Banchettando? I was completely confuse.
I said, "Miguel, but they're not banching with your fish?"
"Yeah.
"Why we have about 20 percent of the fish and the huggles of the bird fishs away of the bird.
Last year on this properties there were 600,000 bird bird over 250 species.
It turned out out the biggest and one of the most importantly health care of the biggest birds in all Europa."
I said, "Miguel, but a population reports of bird birds is not the last thing you would like to be in a fish?"
SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
He said, "We have to sleep in a extensive way not intensive to it.
This is a ecologic network --
The phencoughters eat the legs.
The legs eat the fitoplankton.
So it's much better is the system."
OK, then we would measure? A flies that doesn't give to eat his animals and that measures his success in the health of his predators.
A fish, but also a health hundred further.
Ah, at the way, those phenicopter of them should not even be.
They make the nest in a longtana 150 miles where the soil conditions of the soil conditions of the best construction of the best construction of the best construction of the soil conditions of the best condition of the soil conditions of the best conditions of the best conditions of the best conditions.
Each morning, they flying for 150 miles and get to the flies and they get to the 150 miles for the back of the back.
They do it because they're able to follow the white line, white line of the A92.
How.
I would imagine something like Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, they flying for 150 miles to the fly and then fly 150 miles of night to go back to the back of night to go back to th?
They do it for their little little for their little bit?"
And he looked at me how if I had just quoted a song of Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, do it because food is better than they do it because food is better y."
I don't talk about the skin, I didn't talk about my shine, and I usually not like the skin.
I don't like a abbracustolite, I don't like crash.
It's that knowledge, like asphalt.
It doesn't get it almost away almost away.
And yet, when I brought it in that south of Spain Spain of Spain of the Spaints of the skin.
He had a sweet sweet and clean was like giving a deaths to the ocean.
I said, this in Miguel, and he annued.
He said, "The skin is like a spug.
It's the last defense that any thing well in the fish.
It evolved to hold up the impurity."
And then add "But our water has no impurity."
Okay. A fly that doesn't feed his fish.
A food that that measure its success on the basis of its predators.
And then I realized that when he says that the fluid is not very minimizing a lot of the water that fluid in that fluid in that that fluid is a river, which is a river, which is a river, which is a river, which is a rivers that the rivers are tending chemical skept today.
And when it's gotten down the system, and the water is clean than when it's good.
The system is so in healthy, that can water.
So, not just a farming that doesn't only have to feed up animals not just a food that measure its success in the basic health of his predators and health of his predators and not just for those fish, but a crude of water and not just for those fish, but also for you.
Because when water water goes in the Atlantic water is in the Atlantic water is going to be Atlantic water is going to be in the Atlantic water is in the Atlantic water is in the Atlantic water is going to the Atlantic water and goes out of the Atlantic water and goes to the Atlantic water.
It's a drop in the ocean, but I know the well-being -- and so you should be doing why this romantic love for how romantic love is also istructive ight.
It could say it's a recipe for the future of good food is that fish is that weighs of bovines.
What we now have to do is a range conception of agriculture in which food has really good know.
But for many people, this is a little too radical thing.
We don't realists, we passionate about food.
We are loving love.
We put the little agricultural markets.
We put the little familiar farmers.
We talk about local food.
We eat biological biological --
And when I say these are the things that make sure the future of good food and says, "Hey, you know, "Hi -- you know, you also have a little bit of the readed in the red phenomery food and says, "Hey, but how do you think we could feed the world that the inter?
How do you think we can feed the world?"
Can I be synth?
It's a question I don't like it.
No, because we don't make more than than enough calories that we can feed the world.
One billion people suffering the hunger today.
One billion -- more than we ever -- because of the huge of the huge gathers in the distribution.
You see, I don't like this question because he determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years.
Deating cereal erbiggers to the world's pestick for the chickens to the crows to the fish and all this time the industry -- and all this time the industry -- what is we can we get more people in economic ways; what are we going to do we do?"
This was the motivation.
It was the justify action.
It was the business of the business of American agriculture.
We should call it for what it is, a fast-fast-faster industry that is fastly erodly erodd the capital that makes the measuremental production possible.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our panimal today is not because of the provided in declining and declines in declines not for the last invention for the last invention of the earth of the earth of fertile, but for the land for the fresh water not for mocket and not for the mocket and not for the weighs and not for the weighs and the network.
Do you want to feed the world?
We start asking ourselves: How are we going to do we feed?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that connect to each local community to each other?
To do that, we don't look at the model of the future.
It's a model and stank.
And it all over capital, chemistry and machines and machines had.
We look at the ecologic model of the ecologic model.
It's what it contains about two billion years of the work.
We look at Miguel, to the farmers like Miguel, and farm that are not closed in if they were clear in if they were in the fact that they rebuild instead of consuming farm that they have extensively instead that only extensively instead of that only experts in relationships, because they are the people who are also experts in the knowledges in the knowledges in the knowly.
If I have to be truly best chef chef that I can ever be yet.
You know, at me good, because if that is going to be the future of good food, it's going to be deliver.
Thank you.
I grew up with a further base diet of phantom.
At high school -- I took a school hours and back.
And I was always immersed in a book of phantom -- which was taking my mind in other worlds, and satisfaced in the narrative form, that insatic insnarrative of curiosity I had to be --
And that was manifested in the fact that every time I wasn't at school out in the wood, excurred, excursions, and care for the samples of agning, cut, insects and seats and seats and seats and seats and seats and set and set and seat.
I was a real geek of science.
But it always was trying to figure out the world, understanding the limitations.
And my love for phantom, in fact, it looked like respect the world around me, because what was going on in the earth 1960s, we were going to go on the moon, we were going to go to the moon, explored the depth of the oceans, Jacques Cousteau in our own reality with his fantastic and places that showed us wouldn't have to imagine.
So, it all seemed to be to the phantom my passion for phant.
And I was an artist.
I knew to draw out. I knew painting. I knew painting. I knew to painting. I knew to draw.
And because there were no video games in this sature of film generated to computer, or all of these images in the media landsature in the average of the media landsature in my head.
From a children, when we read a book description of the author description of the author screen.
And so, my answer was painting aliens, the aliens, aliens, robots, robots, robots, navicells and spaces, all this stuff.
And mathematics lessons I was always welled to the shot behind the textbook --
This is because creativity had to find a way of the outside of it.
And it happened to be interesting: the Jacques Cousteau I was very much for the fact that there was a lot of the fact that there was a alien-alien world right here on the earth.
Maybe I never went to a alien-and-a-in the alien-space ship.
It was very unlikely to be unlikely to be unlikely to be very unlikely to brought up.
But that was a world where I could go to very, right here on the earth and exotics and exotics of what I could be able to imagine reading these books.
So, I decided that I would be a subjector of 15 years.
And the only problem was that living in a little country in a little country in the small of the nearest ocean in the smaller ocean --
But I didn't left to go down.
I had my father away in until he found a school of immers' in Buffalo, New York, just spent the confinishing where we live.
And so I did to take the certified in a YMCA in the Fillalo, New York.
And I wouldn't seen the ocean, for two years, until we moved in California.
From then, in the last 40 years, I spent about 3,000 hours underwater and 500 of these hours in submersibles.
And I learned that the depth of the ocean, even the deep oceans, are rich of life that really goes to the way of our imagination.
The imagination of nature is without confined with our human imagine.
Again, I'm intimacy today, I'm seeing when I do the immersions.
And my love story with the ocean continue to the ocean continue, more than ever ever ever was him.
But when I choose a career -- I choose to make film.
It looked like to be the best way to concilize this smany to tell stories with the smania to create imagines.
And I was a guy shot and so on.
So to make film was the only way to put together and stories.
Everything was coming back.
And of course, the stories I chose to tell were phants of phantom, "Aliens," "Aliens" and "The Aliens" and "The Abys."
And with "The Abys" I unized my love, and the immers and immersions with a film.
So, I got the two passions.
From the Abys" came out something interesting that was something interesting that was solve a narrative problem in that film, that creature creature of liquid water creature of liquid water -- we have adopted the animation of the computer.
And so he was the first person to the deatby, and animated to compute that was ever seen in a movie.
And even though the movie doesn't have a lot of money, I would say that to malape was repair of something extraordinary -- all the audience, all the audience, all the audience.
You know, it's the law of Arthur Clarke for which every technology officer is injur in the magic of the magic of the magia.
They were seeing something magic --
And that emotioned me a lot of it.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is something that has to be adopted in the film of the art Chematographic art.
So with "Terminator 2," my next film -- my next film --
And by working with the Industrial Light and Magic, we created the guy of a sun-swept metal liquid in that movie.
And he worked away and we have a magic magic of it.
And we got the same result with a audience.
But we have a little bit more with that movie with that movie.
So, by by by by by these two experiences of experience, I came to the conclusion that this would be a new world of creativity of creativity artists for the film.
So I put up a society with Stan Winston, my my hamic friend Ston, who was the main Stan Winston, which was the main trick and designers in that period, and we called it Digital Digital Domain.
And the principle of society was to leave us the past, analog press opties and so on. And so on. And so on. And then go directly to the digital production of digital production --
And so we did it and he gives us a competitive for a while.
But we were stuck back to half of the '90s in the 1990s in the '90s, which is what we had founded the society.
So I wrote this text called "Avatar," with the intenance of pinger to the male of the visual effects of visual computers, with emotional human person, and all the main the computer, and all the main generated computer-generated characters and the whole world generated to computer-generated computers.
And the whole thing was stay to the mythic.
The guys of the society said that we weren't going to be able to do it for a little bit.
So I slipped it and I did this film of a big name that is a big name that I realize it.
I looked at this one of the "Romeo and Giulietts on a ship.
It would be a epicture of epic, a passional film --
Segretly, what I wanted to do was to be immergery to see the relittle.
That's why I did that film.
And it's truth. I didn't know it.
But I got them up, I said, "We're going to dive us to the reliterally will take it from alive.
We're going to use it for the beginning of the film.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a fantastic."
And I convinced them to financial expedition.
It looks like crazy. But this brings back to the imagination that it makes reality.
Because we really created a reality and six months after I found on a Russia's reality in North Atlantic Atlantic, to look at the real Titanic from a him, not a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in the definition, but for the reality.
I was sleep.
And it took a lot of preparation of preparation -- we had to build Child and lights and slight and a lot of other things.
But I was a flower of those deep immersions, it was like a space missions.
Where it was highly technical and required and required huge planning.
You put it in this capture, you go down in this hair, where there are no hope to be saved to be saved by sun.
And I thought, "Fantastic. It's like to live in a phantom.
It's really amazing."
And so, I was from the deep of the exploration of the depth of the ocean.
Of course, curiosity, scientific component of scientific component.
It was all. It was wallow.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't offer me offering.
Of course, I could imagine a creature and create a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I saw out of the god.
In our next to our next switch I've seen creatures with hydrothermal open and sometimes I ever seen before, things that no one had ever seen before, that there were not even described by science to the science that we had never described by science to the science that we saw it in the time we saw it.
So I was all over this and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision to be a curious decision to it.
And after the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, put my newspapers my day's work of Hollywood, and I do the explorer to a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of ."
So we started to planning these expeditions.
We found us to go to Bismark and exploring it with robotic vehicles.
We went back to the Titanic.
We took little robots that we had created with the optical fiber.
And the idea was to go into and make a surprising within the ship, which was never done.
No one had ever watched in the reliterally of the reality to do it, we have a technology to do it.
So I was at the Titanic, sitting in a market of the Titanic, looking at the asks that seem like these, where I knew that they had sounded violinists.
And I'm driving a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship.
When I say that, I'm driving, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically present within the reliterally of the Titanic.
And it was the experience of the most surreal than ever lives in the sutee, because I had already before I had to turn the corner to the corner of the vehicle of the vehicle of the vehicle for months of the film.
And the set was based on a replicity of the model of the ship.
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience.
And it really really realized that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experiment experiment these avatary, the mind is injected in this vehicle of existence.
It was very deepattern.
And it might be a little bit of what might be going to happen between some decadecade when we start to have cybick for the explorations for other future for other kinds of the future that I can imagine, from the science that I can imagine, from the phantcience that I are.
So we did these expeditions, and it really beginning to appreciate what there was subt, like the open of the depth of the ocean animals where these were staordinary animals where these were staordinary animals where there were these staying.
In basically, they're aliens in the earth.
They live in a chemosynthesis of chemosynesthesis
They don't survive in a system based on the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight in a sunlight in a sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight in a system of the light of the sunlight of the sunlight of the light of the sunlight of the s-based system.
So, you see animals that live close to water water at 500 degrees in the water of water centigradies.
It even looks like to be impossible that there are lots of it.
I was interesting a lot of space science of space science, one again, it's a flu of the science of phantom, from girl.
And I ended up in the space environment, in the consultive of NASA, in the consultive of NASA, to planning space to planning to Russia, to go to Russia, to go to the biomedy space of the pre-cosmonauty, and all of these things, to the international space with our 3D.
It was fascinating.
But what I ended up to do was to bring the space scientists with us in the absolutely in the absolutely of us in the space scientists with us in the absolutely swalking with us in the absolutely --
And bring them down because they could have accessous -- -- astrobiology, scientists, people interested in these extremendous environments, bring them down and allows them to see the samples and so on.
So we were going to be sending documentars, but we actually had science, space science, space science.
I had closed the race between being phantom fan of phantom, to do things to be true.
And you know, during this patow, I learned a lot of it.
I learned a lot of science. But I also learned a lot about leadership.
All of the regist of a leader, the ship of the ship of the ship, or something like that.
I didn't know anything about leadership before to do all those expeditions.
Why do I have to say, "What am I going to do I have to say, "What am I doing here about?
Why am I doing? What do I remember about it?"
You don't make all these spectacles.
We have a bad of them in part.
People almost people think I went to "Titanics" and "Avatar" and I was swalking up the pollen.
I did all these film, all of these film, all of these documentary for a public record.
No fama, no glory, no glory, no money. What am I doing?
I'm doing it for the task in the same, for the challenge -- and the ocean is the biggest challenge that there is a little bon the brilliance of the discovery, and for the bond of people form a team propition.
Because we had all with 10-12 people, and working together, working together.
Sometimes to a 2-three months of files.
And in that lines you realize that the important thing is the important thing is the respect that you have for you, when you ended a task you can't explain anybody else.
When you go back to the Earth and says, "We've got to do this, and the optical fiber, and the optical fiber, all the technology, and the spread of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect of the wild of the perfect of the policemy and they have been on the soldiers that have lived something together.
Creating a bond respect a respect of respect.
When I went back to make my next film for my film -- I tried to apply the same principle of leadership bond of leadership is to make the team and change the team and changing the team and changing the team and they change.
It's really changed dynamics.
And so here I comes here once with a little group, in the inexplored to make a little group, in the early unexisted with technologies that didn't existed before.
Tribly emotional remarkable.
Tremendously impegnative.
And we became a family, in the argument of four and a half years and a half years.
And it completely changed my way to do film.
People have commented by saying that I took the ocean and I put them on the planet Pandora.
For me, it was the beings, the process in the way that was changed.
What can we can we take it now?
What are the lessons we learn?
I think that the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing we have.
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest reality.
And the respect of the group is more important than all of the world in the world.
Young people come from me and I said, "Dammakes me some advice to do this."
And I say, "Don't ponetimes.
Other people do it for you, not not not not not not to be able to be able to yourself.
And you will crop risk."
NASA is always says this sentence, "The errore's not contemplato."
But the mistake has to be an option in the exploration, because it's like to be a saving in the vacuum.
And no important attempt that required innovation has been done without risks.
You have to be declined to these risks.
This is the thinking that I want to leave you, which is that in whatever you do, the mistake, the error is an option, but fearly with it. Thank you.
If I wanted to understand a single idea would be that the set of the data that we consume is more than its sum of his parts, and instead of thinking about the trouble information to make you emerge new relationship to make new relationship of the information to make new relationship of that we can emerging new invisible.
Here you see some statistics of organized mortality of organized mortality of the evidence of the statistics of the statistics of the statistics of the statistics of the statistics of the statistics of the statistics of the statistics of the statistics of the statistics of the mortality of the tips.
This instrument that I use is a little experiment.
It's called Pivot, and Pivott can pick up a single cause, we say accidents.
And it was going to see new relationships.
The reason is that in the central part of the central part of the people are more active and here instead of them are more fragile.
We can make a step back, and reorganize the data for death, we see that circulators and cancerer are the most cable of India's greatest crows and cancer.
If we go away and film for the age of 40, we see that accidents are the causes of death that the accidents are the causes of death that you are worried about more.
Sithrow closer to the man wheels.
So you have to understand that visualize information and data in these way is a little bit like swwimming in a sea of swwall.
And if we can do it with the grew data, why don't we even do with the content?
For example, we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated every Sports Illustrated print.
All of this is all over the network.
You can go into your rooms and try you.
With Piving a decadecade.
Or a specific year --
You can be isolar a number in particular location.
For example, we take athletes that appear in this number of their sports.
I'm a fan in LArmstrong, so I click here and I see all the numbers in which is appearing LArmstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a look at it, I could think "Why don't you look at all the cycle all the cycle thing?"
I do a step back, and then I sat up the visual visual visual.
And I see Greg Lemond.
You have to understand that when you woulders between information in this way closer or further away and further away and backwards and it's not just a search, it's not just a search, it's not a browser.
But you do something else different.
It's a half a half that second us will change how we can use information.
We still have this idea that it can seem a little bit crazy.
We took every single page of Wikipedia and reduced it to a little bit that it is in a little synthy and a little synthy and a icony that indicates the tematic.
I just show you the first 500 between the most visited Wikipedia.
Even in this slide screened we can do a lot of it.
You can understand what tematic areas of the Wikipedia.
And so the government point of government --
Scleft this option we see that the Wikipedia more often associated with this voice is the "Personages of Time Magazine.
This is significant because it makes it emerging something that in the pages of Wikipedia doesn't have it.
And you see it just by doing a step backwards to see the together.
If you take one of these reases can then zooming on the categoria "Personages of Time Magazine.
and see them everybody.
And I see most of the most of government comes from government is from government of science a food number of the world of the science of business from business world of business from business of business from the world of the science of the world of the science of the world of the science of a business of the science of the world of the science of the business of the world of business from the world of the science of the world
Here's my boss.
One is from music.
And what I quite interesting, Bond has a won a TED.
So we save to the all wine of the wine of the premize of the premize of the premize of the premize of the premize of the premize of the wine of the premize of the wine of the wine of the premize of the wine of the premize of the wine of the wine of the wine of the wine of the wine of the premize of the wine of the
For the first time we're really navigating in the network as if it was a rete, not by page to a super level of high astration in the high-astroption level of high astration in the slipage of high astration in the sliption of high astration in the sliption of high astration in the first time of the sliption of the superi
I want to show you another thing that might be surprise --
This is the New York Times.
And Pivot, this application -- we don't call a browser, because it's not a browserve -- we add this technology for zoom to see the Web, we add this technology for zoom to every web, like this.
I can make a step backward and he comes back to a specific section. This is important because the only see the Web. And this is important because the only see my navigation in the same identical way.
I can zoomare about what I did in a moments.
And here you see the state of the deception that I just presented it.
I can see other things that I saw in the day.
If I want to take a step back, and see all I can do with my story or the story or research of my research.
Here I was looking for the newspaper, looking for Lab in Labs Pivot.
And from here I can zoomare on my page and just relaunching from here.
A metaphor reused a lot of times and in every case the result is more than the result of the parts, of partly data of the parts.
Today, data is seen as a kind of bad of mal.
It talks about the subsisicarefully of information.
It is about swing in data.
And if we put all subject if we put the web underwater the Web underwater instead of pass from one thing to the other, we would habited to go from many things to the structure of other to the structure that otherwish would you have hidden up with each other, can we see the structure of hidden from one thing to the otherwish of pass in order to go from one thing
And then instead of hearing us in the data we could really extract information.
Instead of line of information and we can get out of knowledge.
And by knowledge knowledge is also the wisdom to the sagg.
And with this thank you.
All these days all talk about happiness.
I asked to contact the number of books containing the word "happiness in the title and published in the last five years, have stopped to contact after 40, and there were many more.
There's a huge waves of interest on happiness, between the researchers of happiness,
There's very "coaching" about happiness.
Everybody would want to make the happiest people to be happy.
But although this work, there are a series of cognitive traps that somehow cognitive make it impossible to make it impossible elaborate ideas correct on happiness.
My talk about today is going to look most about these cognitive traps.
And it's about it is profanes that think about their happiness, and about how they have to study that we are confused.
The first of these traps is relaluttance to admit the complexity.
It turns out that the word happiness is not a word useful word as a word useful word as a too many field.
I think that you can restringing to a particular means but in the line of massive -- we have to have to display this acception, and we have to adopt the most complicated vision that what is well.
The second traps is the confusion between memorial and memory. It's basically about to choose between happy in life and happy in life and be happy about their life.
And these are two concepting concept of happiness.
And the third is illusion of the focused that we can't think about any circumstance that influence that influence that influence is not a distory about well-being without distory the importance of the importance of the importance of the importance of the importance of the importance of the focused that we can't think about any of any circumstance of the well-being of the distory
I mean, it's a real cognitive trap.
and there's no way to do the right thing.
I would like to start with one example of one person which, after a session, after a session of questions, and he telled a story.
It's not a clear -- Disse that as it was hearing a absolutely magnify in the end of the registration of the registrations.
And then added it in a very emotional that had been in a very emotional experience.
But it wasn't true.
What was the remind of the experience.
He had lived the experience.
And he heard for 20 minutes of the wonderful music of the wonderful music of it.
But that he didn't he's not suspected to a certain -- I remember was sunning, and the rest was everything that remainly remained.
What this episode episode says, in the bottom is that we might think about ourselves and other people in terms of two "know."
There's a saming of experiences, that lives in the present and you know the present, and it's able to revive the past, but it actually has the present.
This is the experience of the experiences and the doctor and the doctor -- you know when the doctor ask -- you know when the doctor ask here?"
And then there's the "he's reminds of the reminds of the story that reminds the doctors and you occupy the story of our life, and it's the "You have to be the doctor's doctor?
or something like you to the journey in Albania?" or something like this.
Those are two different entities of different entities, the experience that lives a experience and what if you remember -- and confounders between the confusion of happiness.
You know, it's a single cantasterories.
And this process starts with a fundamental answer of our reminds -- it starts immediately.
We don't tell stories just when we decide to tell them when we decide to tell them.
Our memory tells us stories, what, what you can be our experience is a story.
Let me start with one example.
It's a old study.
which is it reports the experiences of two patients during a painful procedure.
I'm not going to sweet me in detail. It's not even sweet today, but it was painful when this studio was sweeped in the 1990s.
He asked the patients of report their pain every 60 seconds.
And here is the results for two patients.
Those are their results of it.
If you ask the Choon's two of the raffered of the rain?"
It's a very simple question.
Carly, the Patient B: Patient B:
his colony hit hit down over every minute of the sweweet in the AAgap of the patient of the AAgain, the patient Bs has suffered at least as much as a as a as a or more.
But now there's another question: how much these patients think of the people think of having to suffering?"
And here is the Patient A: Obout the Patient As had a remind of the colony of the Patient B.
The stories of colony were different than a particular part of the procedure is a way that a term of the procedure is particularly positive -- but one of the two of the two is different -- one of the two is particularly worse -- one of the two is particularly worse than the other.
And the worst is where the pain was that that that is the pain the final moment.
It's a negative story.
How do I know it?
Why do we asked these people after colony after colony and even at a time, and even distance was the experience, all the considered of time is the experience, all consideredit?"
and it was a lot of worse for the A-B, in the ricor.
So this is a conflict conflict between the saming that lives the experiences and the saming that the remember.
From the perspective of the experience that lives the experience, is clearly that major Bed that has suffered
So, what you could do for the A, and we actually have clinic, and we actually actually did clinic, and it was really done and it would be able to be able to be able to the colony of the Patient As tending the column without smoot.
This is a little bit of a little bit of paining in the patient, but only a little bit before.
And by doing this for a couple minutes, the same, the experience of the Pati's experience. At the experiences of the Patient experiences. And the he's experiences of the Patient As a better than his experience.
How do you call a story?
And this is for the stories that are from the reminds that for the stories that we invented a story, are the changes and the final moments and final moments and final.
The final is very, very important and in this case, the final has dominated dominated by the end of the dominated ends.
So, the sames that lives the experience lives his life in manier.
It has moments in which lives that suspected and and questions: what happens to these moments to you?
And the answer is simple.
I'm lost to say that most of our life -- as most of our moments of our life -- like I calculated them -- I mean that in a life, psychological says that in a life, we connect about 600 million in the most of the 600 million of the most of the most of the 600 million of which are not left trace.
Most are completely ignored by the samed that remember.
And yet somehow you should be cont, you know, what happens in these moments in these moments of experience is our life.
They're limited the limited resources that we're in this world.
And how to spend it, it seems to detect it, but it's not this one of the story that the reminds for us.
So we have a slides that reminds and a same, that lives are pretty different than it.
The biggest difference between two is how to treat the time.
From the perspective of the same, and the second week is that you live in the vacation is funny as a week as a week of two weeks is two weeks is two weeks is a week.
But this is not absolutely the way that it works the hundred that remember.
For the same, a wall, a two weeks is a week of a week of a week of vacation because there are no new reminds of the addition to addition to addition to addition of the wild wall.
You don't have changed history.
And in this way, the time is the critical variables that distinctive is that remember of the saming that experiences.
She has a limited impact on this story.
Well, the same, the sames that remember the experiences that remember and tell stories.
It's actually the sames that it takes decisions because, if we think we have a patient that has happened, for example, two different colony of different medical doctors and it's what two different medical choices, what the doctor, which is the resize that will be the rest of choice.
The saming experiences of experiences has no voice in these choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experience, but between the reminds of those experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future as experience.
We think we think we have our future as ancient memories of our future.
And basically, you can think of this situation, like a tyranny of the same, and you can think of how if you turn the same, which is that it is that you live the experiences through experiences of any experiences the experiences of any experiences the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the other than the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the other of the across the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experienc
I have a feeling that when we go into the vacation is often the case that you have a good part of the service of our sames that remember.
And this is a little hard to justify it.
Oh, how do we consume our memory?
This is one of the explanations that comes given for the predomination of the sat that remember.
When I think about that, it is a vacation in the Antarctica, a few years ago, which is one of the best vacation of my life, and I think I relatively often relatively often in the other vacations.
And I probably spent to think about that journey of that journey of three weeks to say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I ever let the carefully to 600 photographs of the journey, I would have spent another hour and and a half weeks a hours of journey and a half of a hour.
Well, I could be a little bit of the time, I could be a little bit of the recipe for the reminds of reminds -- but even if you asked more than that, a genuine question.
Why do we take a memory of the weight that we have the experience?
I want you to think about a experiment with thinking about it.
Imagine that during the next vacation of the vacation of the vacation of the vacation of the vacation of the vacation of the amnesia will be destroyed and that you will not rerecognize anything about it.
Would you be weigh? And if you could choose a different vacation? And if you could choose a conflict between two slides and you have to think about how to solve conflict and actually not that because of the conflict and actually not that why, if you think in terms of time you have a answer.
And if you think in terms of reminds and you could get another answer.
The because we pick the vacations, we do it, is a problem that you do with the two of the two of the samong of the two sames of the two sames of the two sames of the sames that we do, is a problem that you do with the vacations.
The two sunners bring two notions of happiness.
There are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use -- one for each other.
So what is it is the experience?
And then you wonder: How happy moments in the same, in the same?
And it's about -- happiness for moments is a complicated process.
What are the emotions that we can measure?
And by the way, now we are able to do us a good idea of happiness of the happiness that lives the experiences in time.
If you ask about the happiness of the saming is that remember, it's a completely different thing.
It's not how happy a living person live.
It's how satisfaced or compleasy is the person when it thinks to his life.
It's a very different idea of it.
Anyone of them is able to distinguish these two notions, not to make confusions of happiness, and I appears to a group of happiness, and I appeared to a group of well-being, and I appearly in this maniera.
The difference between happiness of the experiences of the experiences and explodes of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the slides of the slides to measure the two separately, the Gallup has a world's institute where over over the middle of the most of people have been underneath a world about their lives and their experiences.
And there were other stuff in this direction.
So in the last few years old, we started learning about the happiness of two sususual --
And the biggest lesson we learned -- it's very different about it.
You might know how much a person is satisfaced with your life, and yet this doesn't tell you about how happy they are living their lives and the vicepherd.
To give you a sense of the correlation is about 0.5.
What does that means if you mean that if you mean that if you mean that if you mean that if you mean that if you mean that you know about his heith?
Well, you know something about its alid, but with a lot of uncertainty.
You always have a little bit of uncertainy.
If I tell you somebody thinks that his life is at the eight in a scale from a 10 to a 10 to a 10 to be very uncertain on how happy they are with their own experiences.
So the correlation is low.
We have a certain knowledge of what controls is happy --
We know that money is very important, the goals are very important, the goals.
We know that it's happy to be happy means to be satisfacts with people that we like to be able to be satisfact with people that we like it.
There are other pleasures, but these are the main the main of the main of the main of the other pleases.
So if you want to massive the happiness of the two sususs, you will end up doing very different things.
The conclusion of what I said is that we shouldn't think about happiness as a support of the well-being.
It's about two completely different ideas completely different ideas well.
In more quickly, another reason why we can't think we can think about life, and more reason we can't think about life, and we don't take attention to the same things when we think about life, and when we live in life.
So if you do the simple questions about how happy is a happy people in California, you can't get the correct response.
When you ask this question, you should think you should be more happy in California, which in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contraster between California and other places, and other places and other places and other places and other places --
Well, it turns out that climate is not so important for the same, and it's not very important for the experiences and not very important for the same, which is what it decides how happy are the people are the people.
But because the sames that reflects is in cary, you could finish -- some powerful people in California.
And it's interesting to be able to be able to people that turn into California in California in hope of being happy.
Well, the sames that lives the experiences will not become happy.
We know it.
But something will happen. Think will be more happy, because when they think they think they think they will remember how terrible was in Ohio.
And they will think about having the right decision to be going to take the right decision.
It's very hard to think of clearly about well-being and I think I had the idea of how hard it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question.
Thank you very much.
When we were at the phone a couple of weeks ago, it was mentioned by the sleeping of the Gallup.
Is it something that thinks we can share we still have,
Daniel Kahneman: Oh, of course.
I think the result that the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup is a number that we weren't expected to find.
We found that, with a reference to happy about the experience.
When we looked at how the senters the reddid, we discovered that, we discovered that under a 60,000 dollars a year, for American year, for American year, on a very vast sample of about 600,000 American amers.
CA: 60,000 dollars a year, 60,000 dollars a year, people are ununununhappy, and they become progressively more infections like become poor, Al of the one of that we find a flap.
I mean, I saw the rarely line so much more.
All of the money that happens is that money doesn't buy the happiness of experience, but the lack of money than the money of money than the serious of money -- and we can measure that misery very, very clearly.
In terms of the other hand, the same, it's another story.
More money leaders, more content seases.
This is not really, in emotions.
CA: But Danny, all the efforts of Americans are about life, the liberty, the research of happiness.
If people take this discovery, in the discovery, it basically falls everything we believe, for example, politics on the tissue and so on.
There's the possibility that politics, and the country in general, can you take a discovered as that seriously and bringing a public politics based on it.
DK: You're that I think that it recognize the role of happiness in the politics.
The press of consideration will be slowed in the U.K., but in the U.K., it's becoming reality, and in other states.
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about the politics.
It will be able to study and people will start to talk if they want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the valuable of the valuable to the more than we need to start this dibactive pretty soon.
As you think of happiness, it takes different directions to how you think about the slides of how you think of the slide that it makes the experiences.
This is all of this influence will be true, I think, in the years that was going to be true.
In the United States, are doing some efforts to measure the experience of happiness of the population.
And that, I think, will come in the next decade, maybe two of the country.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this is going to be like that, or for the most interesting political discussion of political political discussion to follow in the next years.
Thank you very much, we invented the behavioral economy.
Thank you Danny Kahneman.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate.
It can seem strange, because in my work to the foundation to be more vaccines and seeds to help the world to help two billion people more poorest to help the two billion people more poors.
But climate and energy, in fact, they're extremely importantly important for this people, are more important for them than anyone else in the world.
A lot of climate worst for many years, for many years,
It will be too much rained or too little bit.
The things will change their fragile in ways that their environmentally cannot sustain.
which is it leads to the fame. At conflict.
So climate change climate camps, will be for them terrible to them terrible awful for them terrible awful climate camps.
The cost of the energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you can lower the price of one thing, to reduce poverty, to reduce poverty, to choose much energy.
The price of energy is down in time.
And a civilization progress to progress in energy field.
The coal revolution of carbon has allowed that industrial revolution of the carbon
And even in the 20th century we seeing a quick decline in the price of electricity, which explain why we have frigerators, we can create modern materials and do so many things.
So in the rich world is how we are about the electricity in a situation of excellent situation.
But while the price sliprice for example, of the half of the CO2.
CO2 is a climb climb up the planet, and his equation.
CO2 empowered a temperature, which induces very negative effects of negative effects of temperature,
And the climate, maybe even worse indeed, in the sense that the natural ecosystems can't get adeal with these rapids changes and so they collapsed to these rapids changes and so they collapsed up.
The valuable of the temperature of a CO2, and as each other, as each of CO2, and as each one of the two things worst is uncertainly until that is uncertainly not much.
And there's certainly uncertainly about how negatives will be so much negative to be extremely negativic --
At the best scientists -- I often asked to the best scientist: are we really going to have to be reduce the emissions of the best scientists almost to zero-reduce scientists to zer?
We can't only reduced to a quarto?
And the answer is that, until we don't get almost zero, the temperature will continue to salie.
It's a great challenge, so that's a challenge, so that's a great challenge, so that's a great challenge.
It's not like to say, "Let's go through a 3.5 feet in a 3.5 miles under 3.5 fe."
It's not about "let to bring it a whil."
It's where we have to go to zero.
Now, we embodies CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons.
About 20 tons for every American tons for every American --
For the poors of poor, is less than a ton that capital is less than a tunk capita.
The world's average is about five tons of capital.
And somehow we have to make progress that quantity to zero.
The emissions are constantly constantly slipt --
Suntil some changes have changed this tendency, so we have to go from the increasing to the declining up to the zero.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series of multiplations.
We have the left, CO2 embodies to be built and the CO2 empowered factors on the right is population, the services that in average every person use, the average of every person usually average and CO2 empower for energy.
We go to each factor and we see how we can see how we can can do it.
You know, one of these numbers have to let up in zero.
It's about high high school algeebry algebrings.
We see a little bit.
The first face is population.
The world has today 6.8 billion abitant billion abitants.
We go to nine billion.
If we do a good job with the new vaccines, health reproductive and health reproductive -- we can declined 10, 15 percent, but we regist a 30 percent.
The second factor is the services that we use it.
It knows everything, the food we eat, the vestarium, the TV, the warming.
They're wish, and free of poverty means to provide these services for almost everybody in the world.
And it's a good thing that this number of increases.
In the rich world in rich billion more rich of the rich world, we probably could save and use men, but in average, every year, this is a saliery number of salize.
And so complex, the amount of services are going to be that double capable of the double for the purpose.
This is a very simple example of service.
You have the illumination in your house to do company, but these guys are not so they read and reading their tasks to the streets.
How much efficiency -- E, the energy for a service -- here are very good news -- here are good news.
This is not increasing it.
Thank you very much. And many inventions, new ways of illuminate different different ways, automobiles made different different services of services can declined to several energy.
In some services you can reduce 90 percent.
There are other services, like fertilizers, or aircrawling -- where the margins of improvement are very, very infertilizen are very, very infertilized,
So, complex, in the best of the best consumed energy can reduce from three to three to maybe six times.
But these first three factors reduce emissions from 26 to the best of the best of the tons 13 billion tons of tons.
It's not enough.
Let's look at the factor, the key amount of CO2 embodies for energy.
The question is, can we can we reduce it to zer?
If you burn carbon a coal, no.
If you burn natural gas, no.
Any ways to produce the electricity today the electricity, to part of the renewable and nuclear CO2.
And what we have to do on global scale -- and it's to create a new system.
And we need energy miracrocoast.
And so Cethen," I don't mean something impossible.
The myroprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle.
Internet, and his services, I'm a miracle.
People here have participated with the creation of many miracles them.
We usually don't have a scadence, a data within which I think you can deliver.
You are at the window, and something happens and something else -- something else now.
In this case we have to lead to all the speed, and make a miracle in very rise of very rise of ties.
I wondered, how do this concept that?
Do you have some natural example, some of the imagination of people?
I rethought about a year ago, when I brought to the mosquitoes and people found it fun.
He realized them that in the world, there are people who are connected with mosquitoes.
This is my idea for energy.
I decided that to fly slightly would be this year my contribute.
Here's the lights here.
They say they don't spot up, you know, they could not get out of the boat.
So now, we can invent it as this -- but they won't be help.
We need solutions, a lot of them or so many that they are, that works on great scale and very affified in a lot of directions, and although of five can be surprising effects in many directions,
I exclassroom, the geo-combustic, nuclear fusion nuclear fusion of biofuel --
They could also give some contributes, and if they can do more than I expect that I expect me expect me expect that we should work on each of these five, and not swalking all of these five, and not swalking out of that, because all the challenges of the difficult challenge challenge to it.
We go for the first fossil fuel fuel fuel or gas or natural fuel or gas or gas that it is.
Here we have seems to be simple but it's not to take CO2, and it's not to take the CO2, after the combustion, to the city of the figure it, put it somewhere, and hope that we can get us with it.
There are experimental technologies that capture 60 percent of CO2, 80 percent CO2, but reach to 100, will be very complicated and it's going to be hard to be hard to deal with all of this CO2 --
The most spinous issue is still that in the long term of the long term.
Who will be true?
Who will gave something that is literally billions of times more voluminous than every other kind of reject of all sorts of imagine, like nuclear or others?
It's a huge volume huge volume --
So it's a difficult problem.
Another would be the nuclear bond.
But nuclear presents three big problems.
The cost, especially in the countries is very high.
The issue of safety safe, the feeling of the security can go wrong with human operators, and that the spread of human operators, and that the combustible doesn't come to beautiful purposed.
And how do you manage the scores?
Malgrade redopt and the worried, concerns are so much of it.
People need to be renched.
So you can get very hard problems, and everywhere, you could solve and on what you should work with.
The last three of the five sources I sliped them up.
These are those people often define "rus."
And to say the real vantage of the great advantage of not to require a fuel.
The first is that the density of energy produced with these technologies is decidedly unfairly inferior in electrical central electrical central of electrical central power.
This is about "to harvest energy to collect energy, and so many square miles of a thousand more times than a normal electrical central electrical central power.
And these sources are intermid-sources.
The sunlips doesn't shapes all day, not all the day, and the wind soil.
So if you depend on these sources you have to find a way of heroes when the source doesn't produce.
Grosse challenges attend us on the front of the cost of the costs.
And the distribution of distribution --
For example, we say that this energy source is to the outside.
So not only need technology, but you also have to do the technology, but you also have to do the risks that slides an aerad.
And finally, the accumule of the accumulate problem.
For stimate the size of the problem, I analyzed all kinds of bacteries that are realized today, and all of the bacteria, and whatever touch them with the amount of electrical energy electrical energy electrical energy that all the bacteries now in production could be able to produce less than 10 minutes of all of the energy.
So you really need a big favor, a half improvement to the approaches now in use.
which is not impossible, but it's not very simple.
This problem is already when the source source sets of dols, say, 20 or 30 percent of consumes.
If you go to those sources for 100, you need a miracle battery battery --
But how will we have on this street up? What is the right approach?
Is a Manhattan? What could you solve the problem?
Many company, at hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundred hundreds of them in hundreds of hundred hundreds of them in hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of them in hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of them in hundreds of hundreds of seases.
We need at least people in each of these five sectors.
Many of them, looking at them, you see, the definitely calls them him.
And I think that here, in the TED group of TED, many people are working in these fields already working in these fields
Bill Gross different companies between which one of the eSolar that a vantge of large technologies in the termic solar that a great technologies in the terms of the thermic solar that a greater called eSolar that a vantaggas that a eSolar that a vantaggas that a eSolar that a vantaggas that a eSolar that a vantaggs in in in the terms of a lot of different companies, between which is a lot of a companies in which is called eheadvants of the ea great ea great equiplots
Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting things and potentially interesting and have interesting the support of this one.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that you will smilar you follow the street of nuclear --
There were some innovations, modular nuclear -- modular nuclear with a liquid bounds.
But from a little time of time, the sector is hurmy, that there are some good ideas around is not so amazing.
The idea of Terrafy idea is that instead of burning only the uranium, the U235 percent of the available uranos, we decided to burning the U.238, 999999999999999999999 percent of the crazy.
For the truthanks, but it never was adequately provided if it would work or not, just because of the wall, you can do a simulation and see that yes, with the modern materials can do with the right materials -- it would be that work.
And because it turns out 99 percent of the uranium, the structure of the best costs the best costs of the best costs
They burn the scores, and they use as fuel as fuel fuel the exacts, which is the problem that they were going to be a source resource of the problem that they were going to be a source.
It is consume the uranison procept of proced. It's a kind of canlandscape.
It's like a wood wood that burn is burn called the reactor.
From the point of the fuel point of the combustible problem is solve.
Here's a picture of a place in Kentucky.
This is the line 99 percent of the uranium, which was taking the hours of the uranium is now called a fuel hour.
These energy would give them energy to the U.S. for centuries.
And by filtering water with a economic process, there would be a lot of the rest of the life of this planet.
So a lot of challenges attended, but this is an example of hundreds of ideas that we need to progress.
How should we measure our progres?
What should they have to count the pay?
We Identifire out the goal and then we have the past of the medium.
You've heard a lot of people talk about 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's very important to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
20 percent will be produced by poor, and from a little agriculture.
At that point, we have solved the deforestation and production of cement.
So to get to 80 percent, so that the developed countries, including nations like China, will have to replace completely their electrical production of their electrical production of electric production
The other question is, are we doing this technology to zero-emission?
We put it in practice in the developed countries?
We're going to spreading it even else?
It's a important.
It's a key element of the page.
Would you go to the page of 20?
And that should have the same two expects of it.
We should implementing of efficiency measurements to start to get reductions.
Meno embit'll be the total amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this material, doing things that doesn't behave great reductions, has a weight just part, or even until well-sharp -- and the speed of innovation of new inventions.
We have to push these progress all over speed, and we can measure the speed of the number of companies, projects pilots, plyy-modifies.
Many opties have written books have been written about it.
The Al Gor, "The Gor: and the David McKay, "Sustainable Sustainable Sustainable Without the Hot Air."
These books bees the problem and create a context in which to do the dibute because these things need to be a substantial sustain.
Many things have to have contemporary contemporary of it.
So I have a wish, so I have a wish.
A very concrete that we will invest that we have technology to have the technology necessary.
If I had to choose a wish for the next 50 years, you know, I could choose the president of the country, the realization of a vaccine, which I can keep on the half of the way that is half and not make CO2, you can't make this last machine.
It would be that in the greatest impact.
If this wish is not going to be doing the fraction between who thinks and who's long-terrible and the U.S. and China, between countries and China, between countries and rich, the life of those two billion people will be able to be much worse.
What do we have to do we have to do we have to do we have to do we have to do that?
What am I invite you to take the initiative and proced?
It's necessary more substitute, you know, you have to research.
When countries reunder the countries like Copenns should not just talk about CO2.
They should be discussion also should be the innovations, and stupid how much much much of invested in these innovative approaches.
We need incentives, taxes on CO2, the "cap and trade," instruments that evidence the cost of the pollution.
We have to spread the message.
We have to make this more rational dialogue and understandable and understandable and understandable and including the choices of the government.
It's a challenging wish wall, but I think it's able.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you. Sp for the says more on Terrapower of Terrapower, there is --
before all, you can give us a idea of the investment?
Bill Gates: Read the software, to buy the supercomputer, to be all the great scientists, what we already did already in a Realthize of the materials in a Russian reactor, to be sure that works to be just talk about hundreds of millions.
The hard thing is to build the floor of the reactor, the competent of the competent that will be built the first one of them will be built the first example.
Once we built the first one, if it works like announced -- it's going to be the Colomb, because the costs, the density of generated energy that we know today.
CA: So if I understand this imply pattern, it is a construction of a vertical combustible combustible nuclear fuel of nuclear urany of these kinds of uranium urg.
Then the process starts from the high-and progress to the basic so?
BG: Yeah. The reactors, today, are being continuously reforness, many controls that can not work, opens that they have to not work, opening and exactly --
It doesn't really good.
If the fuel fuel is very cheasier and you can get down for 60 years -- and put it for 60 years -- and forgotten all of complexity.
It is burns burns for sex, and then finished.
CA: A nuclear nuclear implants that makes from itself!
BG: Yeah. Well, you can let them leaved there can be taking them up in another reactor.
And we will start with the existing refying in the wind-cooling containers in the wind-cooling containers close to reactors.
They will be our first fuel.
So what was a problem of conventional reactors will be the fuel of the nostris, and the volume of the refying of refying refying this process will be reality.
CA: But when I talk around the world of the potential of this technology where is more interest reduced interest to his realization?
BG: Well, there's no place place in particular and there are all these interests rules about transparency about everything that's defined nuclear -- so I can get interest.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I just met the Segretary for Energia.
We spoke about how this idea is to address to the current program.
I'm optimist. Francescesies and Japanese did in this field.
It's a variation of something that has been done.
It's a sustaining improvement but it's a fast-fast, which many countries have built a construction of a fast-built reactor, so that many countries have built a good candid-taken our reactor.
CA: Are you have, what are the days, and the probability that something like to do you realize that?
BG: Well, for one of these projects at the entire scale that produces energy, which is not a very, we talk about 20 years to design it.
This is the scadence that the environmental models demonstrate being tassative.
Terrapower, if all of this good, that it's not asking a little bit of a little bit of dish that goal.
And now they are, lucky, fortunately, dozens in the sector, if they are function, if the fundamental research for their piloss of the pilots of their piloss of the pilots of their pilots of piloss of competition.
And it's better if many solutions have successful if many solutions have successful to a set of solutions.
It's necessary that at least one success.
CA: Would you talk about important, revolutionary, this is the biggest you know?
BG: A energy revolution is the most important.
It would be without the environmental wine -- but the wind wine it was very much more important.
We have other innovators.
We don't know their work well as well as this -- but one is the nuclear nuclear of the nuclear approach.
There's a liquid reactor. It seems to me to do that, but maybe they say the same thing that we have us.
So there are different different things, but the beautiful is that a molecule, a molecule, a million times more energy than a million times more energy than a molecule, if you can deal with the negative aspects -- if you can deal with the negative aspects on and other, in terms of effects on the environment, and otherwise, in terms of the environment, and so that it is a class of the energy of the energy is that a hundred of the energy of the energy of the folds of a molects of the
CA: And if it doesn't work that work?
We shouldn't we start to get emergency to try to maintain the planet of stable lands?
BG: If you have that situation, it's a little bit like when you eat too -- and you have a heart attack.
Where do you have to have that point? You might have to have a surgeon or something like this.
There's a whole research line, which is a research line that are various techniques that would slow down the rewarming of the rewarming facing us 20 or 30 years in which coordinate the action.
It's like to stick a polyness polyan.
I hope you don't have to have to have it.
Some people say that you shouldn't even work on the poly-because you could be in the polyoung because you can be savailed to save you wouldn't save you
I don't think it's a same, seeing the importance of the problem of the problem of the geoengineering of the solutions in the case that the falls in the case that the fall, or the innovation coming more than the predict of the predictions in the predictions.
CA: Cececk: if I had a sentence or two to dir them, how could you persuade them that they have come back to it?
BG: Well, it too much, there are different types of skeptics and the ones that are very few of the things that are very few of them.
Some people say that there is a fedback negative fedback to the clouds that sleep the effects of warming.
I'm very, very few things that things you can only say that there is a probability on a million that you have a probability on a million that you have the main the main the AIDS.
You start a mistay and you paying the consequences only a lot of later.
And so, when you're in six emergence, the idea of doing sacrifices that you see results that you see results --
It doesn't be sacrifice to away for you not well know.
In fact, the IPPPPC doesn't prospect that the IPPC doesn't necessarily prospect case that is a bad world that looks at IPPC and says, OK, it's not bad the bad of the IPPC and says, "OK, it's not bad in the rich world that is not bad.
The fact is that uncertainty should be push to action.
But my dream is, if we can do that if we can make it economically, and respect the wine of CO2, then the skeptics diggers: I don't care if you don't emitt CO2, almost preference, but I would accept it because it's more economic technologies -- but I would accep.
CA: It would that be your response to the reason of Bjorn Lomb, who if you invest all all your energy and trying to solve the problem of CO2, your other goals -- you know, you know, that will be sacrificed. And that will be sacrificed. And that put the money in a way stupid thing?
BG: Well, the expensive expensive and developing --
We say that the U.S. should spend 10 billion in more than they do now is not so the ingertip.
It shouldn't distraction to other discopys.
The things that behavior, and here people are reasonable to be reasonable to deal with ancient funded solutions.
For me is most of that, I know.
Because you don't have a fashional learning curve, closing to learn to the point where it will become very economic efforts of bons are focused in technologies that have the potential to lower the lower of low-low-low-low-low-stick dramatically.
If the alternative of the fosse: we make cost-cost-sissive energy as a recognize that only rich rich the energy can afford to pay the energy five times as much without changing life.
The disaster would be for those two billion.
And Lomborg has reviewed his positions.
His argument is is, "Why don't you have to talk about Ricerk and Switche?"
For his past is still a collective butting between the swall, but he realized that it's a sweet slipt group, and so it's a bunch of Ricerk and Svilup.
And it's a question I think it's appropriate to him.
It's incredible how little little bit of a little bit of a little bit and development.
CA: Well, I think of the dolphy of the audience saying that I hope to see your desire to be to see your desire to become reality.
BG: Thank you.
I want to share with you a discovered that I did a few months ago while I was writing a Wired.
I always have my dictionary of symonymen in the hand every time I write something, but I had already up to correct the word "disastable to see what I would have been in my life looking for the word "disastic to see what I would have found out.
Let me read you the result.
"Deat," aggettive -- indeed, unuseful -- indeed, unuseful, slicked awesides, uncut up, awwould, suckered, unpowerful -- impoverty, impoverty, very powerful paralyzed and debols. Senile, decrept with the circulation, clate and debols.
Contrary -- hold, able.
I was reading this high list at a friend to a friend and beginning, it was so ridiculous, but just reading my voice skilled my voice skip spot to recodle of shock and the impact of these words have left me and the impact of these words have left to me on these words have left me --
You know, we're talking about a finger of my old dictionary of the synonyms.
I'm thinking, it's going to be a very old building.
But, in fact, the data was the first years, 80s.
when I was starting the elementary schools and learning what existed out of my family and things about things and other kids and the world around me.
And by the way, thank God I didn't use to God not to use the dictionary of the symonymous to that time.
I mean, from this explanation seems that I was born in a world that seem like one who has nothing positive in any way for them, whatever it is nothing about what the opportunities and the adventure that my life has procured.
So, I am immediately settled to see about 2009 in the network, expected to find a review without value.
This is the version of description of description version of description.
Unfortunately, it's not very much better.
I find the last two words under the last two words under the sameurs, "inter" and healthy and healthcare and "he" --
That's what we believe people when we nominate them with these words --
It's about valuable values behind these words, and how we build these values.
Our flu language our thinking and our view of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, many ancivilizations, including that Greek and the Romana, believed that it was more powerful than the verbally voice to the bad things to existence.
So, what do we want to bring to exist, a person who is limited or person with the major force?
So if you do something simple as a person as a person, a child, we could put it on a child, we could put it on the shadows on their force.
We don't want to open up the port of port for them?
One person who opened the doctor of that I was the doctor of that I was a little girl Apand-A-institute in Wilmington Wilmington Wilmington Wilmington Delaware.
His name is Dr. Pizush Pizush
Italoamerican, which I had a name of the name was too hard to pronounce for most Americans, so it became doctors.
And the door to wear door to wear door to swear and food had a perfect to work with a children.
I was almost any thing of the time I spent in hospital, with the exception of physical sessions of physical sessions.
I had to do what seemed to be infinite repetitions, with these big elastic sses and elastic skills, you know, to help build the muscles of the legs.
And I hate these elastic elastics anything.
I hate them and I have them really hated.
And, you know, I knew to hold hold holding out of five years, with Dr. I have to try to get out of these exercizes, Inumic yell.
And one day, it came to one of my sat and sat and and unexorable -- these sat and unexorable -- these seats.
and he said, "Oh, you know, you have a child so he's a child so fortune, I think I went to break one of those skills.
"When the romunds, I'll give you 100 dollars."
Now, clearly was just a little maneuversus of the doctor, and you know, that I didn't want to do the front of perspective of the second plan, what he did did was the richest of the second plan, what he did did was to give a different shape of a different shape in day.
and turn it into a interesting experience for me.
And I wonderful today, the entity of his vision, and his declaration about me as a lucky child, he redefined my view of me in a lucky, powered and the personal person to the future.
This is an example of how adults with a position of power can inflam,
But, in the first of those definitions of the vocabulary of the mayor onimis, our language is not for evolved to evolved to the reality that everybody wants to see if we all want to see if you like.
Our language, not at the step of changes of our society, many of the society, many of which have been created by technology.
of course, from a medium, from a medium, my legs, my legs operations to the laser eye, and also recognized headvance and even recognized for aging bodies that are helping people to cooperate with their abilities, and move the ability that nature has impoint, to the platform of the social networks to deck their diseases of declaring with people to description of their choices to description of their choices to describes to their choicate choice.
So, maybe technology is revealing us more clearly what has always been a truth, which each one has something rare and power to make it and power to our society, and the human ability to adapt us to do is our biggest quality.
The human ability to adapt it, it's something interesting, because people always wanted to talk to me to talk about difficulty sources and I have to admit challenge and I have to admit you cheap.
This sentence never good, and I sented up to me in the answer people to this review that I think I'm starting to understand why.
It's subject in this sentence, insurprisable adversity, is the idea that successful or happiness, is to reemerging from the other side of a challenge of this experience, if my success in life of this experience, if my success in life has come from a schiving schiving or circumnavigate the present of a life with their protess, or what people lose like my disability.
But in fact, we have changed, we changed, we are changed, logically, from a challenge, physically or both both of a challenge, or both both of a challenge, or mind.
And I would suggest that it's a good thing.
The avoid is not a obstacle that we have to address our life.
It's part of our life.
And I told to think it's like my shawwwel.
Sometimes you know that much, and sometimes almost for nothing -- but it's always with me.
And of course, not the slide of diministration and the fish, the weight of a person.
There are the adversities and challenges in life, and it's all true and relative to every single person, but the question is not if you have adversities or or or not, but how you go to deal with it.
So, our responsibility is not just to protect people to us to care about ourselves from avversity, but to prepared them in the right way.
And we do a giving of our children when we do it to feel that they are not prong.
There's a difference and distinction between the medical medical objective of being a amputed person, and the subjective of the society that I seen to me or not.
And truth, the only disability is that I had to deal that I had to describe that I could be described by those words of the words.
In our wall of those that we loving a cold of the cold of a cold truths on their medical prognos, really, the rest of their expectancy of life, and we have to be safe the first morning, we have to be able to deal of disability in a wall that they would be someone in a wall that they would be able to disability to deal of their expectancy for their expectancy to protect the wall that we have to defe with their expectancy disastict of their protect of life,
Maybe the model of looking at only at what you have roted in you and how to put it back to you, can indebuly more the subject that the disease of the disease of the subject that the disease itself.
In not to hold a person in the complete, not to do to understand his potentiality, we are creating another disease of disease in addition to the natural suffering that already have no disease in the natural suffering that already have no disease in the natural fact that already have a disease in the fact that already hanging a disease of the disease in the not to do with a person in the whole bunch of not to be doing having a hand.
We're actually going to be a value of a person in our community.
So we have to see through the disease and within the elency of human ability.
And much more importantly, there's a relationship between those insufficiency perceived and our greatest creativity.
So, it's not to be proposed to svalue, these number of researchs like something we want to avoid or or discovered under the dunder the douse, but rather to find those opportunities tell in a accident.
So, the idea that I want to explain is that there is not what as to be a adversity, as a way to be able to be able to use a term of the lotation of liber, maybe even dance of the lotest of the lotest of the lotest of the lots, maybe even dance of the lotop, maybe even dance to use a term of the lotage, maybe the idea of the floor of the flots, maybe the idea of the lots, maybe the idea of the free of the idea that I want to be that you to explain the read that you can be that you can be that is that is that you want to explain the idea of explain the idea that there is that you have to explain the way to be that is that you can be that you can be that you have to be that we have to be that you can be that you want to be that you
And perhaps, if we look at a crink like a natural and useful thing and useful from his presence.
This year celebrate the two-inner complete Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when he writing about evolution, which Darwin has illustrated illustrated by the truths of human carefully careful of human carefully carefully --
And to say it in another way, is not the strongest of the expects that survive, and it's not even the most smart, is what the most smart of the changes.
The conflict is the genesis of cracking.
Darwin, between other things, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and developed with the soffering and developed from the spirit of the human spirit through the conflicts in transformation.
So, again, transformation, adaptly; it's our biggest quality.
And perhaps, we don't know what we have to try and except we don't know what we're made of.
Maybe that's what adversity, it makes us sense of the possibly can be -- a sense of its force.
So we can make a gift.
We can imagine available to imagine available things.
Maybe we can see it as a change.
The avversity is a change that we don't still adapted.
I think the biggest adversity that we created is this idea of normality. Now, who is normal?
There is no normal CA: There is a typical. There is no normal of it.
And you want to meet those few grid people if there are it?
I don't think about it.
If we change this paradigm from one of how to get the normality to be able to be able to be adigrim to be adigrim of so many kids to be able to understand the strength of so many children, and invite them to their precious capacity with community.
The anthropologists teaching us that what we us, as human, we always wanted to be help, to be able to contribute.
There is an evidence that in Olanda, 60 of the old trip, they brought to the old trip and the subjects with fers, and perhaps and survival, maybe because of the experience and survivalue of these people was the value of the community of the value of the community of the value.
Something ago, I was in a citizone of the citizones in that red area in the north of the Pennsylvania.
and I was in front of a touching of a touches.
I was summer and I had a short of the bounds.
I heard this guy, his voice behind me and said, "Aimee Mullins." And I took me and I flew this man of half age. I didn't have any idea of who was in who was there.
And I said, "Do you have to lead us -- I don't remember to have it in the house I ever met you met them to have met you met to have met you haven't remember to having me on.
I mean, when we met you were born on the bread of your mother."
GOh, that guy.
And of course, but I was surely playing a camp.
That means was Dr. Kean, a man I had to know about a man I had only from my mother on that day, because of my mother on that day, because of clear, typically, I came to retary.
And so, the kneecologist of my mother was gone to vacations, so the man who did me was a complete extraneous extraneous for my parents.
And because I was born without the lost and I had the bones in this food, some finger-to-him, and some of them in this extraneous mly had to consigned the bad news.
He said, "I had to give me this one of your parents you would never walked up with my childhood that you would never have a walken of mobility that have other children or no independent, and you gave me a good kind of independent, and I gave me a good thing that I had had been told me that he had taken me on the childhood, which I had had gone in the day-day on the childhood, a basic concord.
that I had marched with Girl Scout, you know, the Halloween, I had won my house studio, or all of the sports of my studio, or all of sporting sports and use them -- entertained and use them and Hershey.
And he called this part of the course of the X, the X, the potentiality of human will will will be a
You can have no progrid of how power can be and and how determining in the quality of a person.
And the Kean Kean continued to explain and said, "Nella my experience, unless you have been told repeated, and even though it is given a bon-has, if it comes up a child come to a baby -- a child come up with us.
You see, Dr. Kean has changed his opinion.
He has a difference between a medical condition, and what each one can do with it.
And there was a change in my thinking about the years, if you had 15 years old, if I had 15 years old, if I had 15 years old, if I wouldn't have a second.
I was going to be normality to that time,
If you ask me today, I'm not safe today.
And it's because of the experience I had with them, not for the experiences I had with them.
And maybe the change in me is happened because I was more to people who opened to me the door of those who opened me to the door of those who obstacularly had to be in the fact that I had been in my own beings that I had been expose to me in the door of those who opened me to the door of those who opened me to the door of those who opened me to the door of those who opened to me to the change the people who opened in me him.
You see, everything you need is a person that you show you the epiphysical of your potential and you have a game of your potential -- if you can give someone the key -- if you can do it is so rich, if you can do it and open a door to someone in a cras, you can be a door someone in the best of the modis.
You are taught the doors away from itself.
In fact, the meaning of the word education is from the "education is from the "De" that means -- to bring out what in the potential of the potential of the potential of the potential of the potential of the potential --
So again, what is the potential that we want to get out of it?
There was a case study in the 1960 in the 1960 in Grand short schools to the average schools to the average of the average of the average 60 in the 1960 in the 1960 in the 1960 in the 1960 in the 1960 in the 1960 in the 1960 in the 1960 in Grand short in the 1960 in the 1960 in Grand short in the 1960 in Grand short in the 1960 in the 1960 in the 1960 in the 196
It's called the "continuity," we call it the "alinevidence here in the States.
It means separate students dependent on their voices.
And students with the best voices have a harder program, and so much better teachers -- and they did it for a three months, and students with voices in the officer they were good at the optimos." The Gef -- they said they were smart -- that were intelligent.
And at the end of this period of three months, were having a results of the optimos," the sadly well of this study of this student student of this student student -- and they took students -- and that they had a "insufficent enough." And this is what happened to the end of the three months.
The ones that were stuck at school, over to those I had left to the ones I had left
The critical part of this study was that even the teachers were winger-indeed.
The teachers didn't know that was that change.
The simple was just told -- these are the students and and these are the ones with insufficient office.
And so it's like they started taught up.
So I think that real disability is to have a damage, and a damage, and a damaged damaged not has hope.
It doesn't see beauty.
It doesn't have our natural children, care and our inner skills and our innate ability to imagine.
if you aging it, we can support the human spirit to keep the hope, to see the beauty in the other people, to be imaginative and curious curious curious and curious curious of the correctly.
When you have these quality, we can create new reality new reality and new ways of it.
I want to leave you with a poem poem from a 1300 called Hafiz who had 1300 called Hafiz Jacques Dembois to have my friend Jacques Dembo's friend Dembo's friend Dembo's 1300 called Hafiz --
and the poem is called "The dio that knows just four parole," "Every child -- "Every child -- not the God of NO, the God who only knows know about four words and continued to the four-a-field dance, and continued to dance with me."
Thank you.
