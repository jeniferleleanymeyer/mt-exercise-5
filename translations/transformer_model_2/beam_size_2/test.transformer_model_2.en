Sinchallenge, here at TED, Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
Turns of four people have to build the highest possibly possible to make the highest possibly than by using 20 spaghects, a feet of spaghects, a feet of spaghement and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow must be wallowed to the top to the top of the tower to the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top to the top of the top to the top of the top of the top to the top of the top to the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top
And, even though it looks very simple, it's pretty difficult, because the people to collaborate very quickly.
So I thought it was an interesting idea, and I incorporated it in a laboratory on the design on the projection.
And it was a huge success.
And since then, I organized about 70 laborators of these kinds of these kind of designers in the world with students, designers and architects, even research and development companies Fortune 50.
There is something in this exercise that you can see the lessonsons about the nature of collaboration, and I'd like to share some of these lessons with you.
Normal, most of the people are starting with the original compit to the compiece of it.
They talk to be about the power would be expect that might be expect for the power, then they go through the planning.
They do squarters and preavavails and preavavails.
You have the greatest part of the time at the summer of time to assembling the spaghi in buildings, right when it's going to fall, somebody out the marshmallow, and fall, and fall, and fall, make a step back and fall.
They're just going to be.
But what happens really, the most of the times of times is that the "Ta-da-to-to-to-hmallow -- because the sea weight of the sea weight of the sea structure.
There is a number of people who have more moments "uh-oh-o-h-o-h-to-ol businesses.
But, they walked away away and they create absolutely transballing.
And there are of course groups that have many more structure," and in the best of the childhood schools of childhood.
And it's amazing.
It says Peter, not only create the highest structures, but they're also the most interesting structures.
And your questions will be like that? What is it possible? What do they have to particular?
And Peter love saying, "No of the kids spend time trying to become the SpA." Right.
They don't spend time competing for the power.
But there is another reason.
And the reason is that economy students are formed to find the single best project.
And then you get it.
And then what happens is that when they put the marshmallow at the top, they don't have longer, and what happens about that?
The crisis.
You sounds familiar? Right.
What children are doing differently, is that they start from the marshmallow, and build prototypes, one after each other, and they have always different possibilities to add prototypes to address on the top of prototypes.
The designers recognize that these kinds of collaboration is the essence of the process.
And with every version, the children have a feedback of what works and what it doesn't work.
So the ability to work on prototypes, it's essential, but we see how different different working groups.
The average for most of people is about 50 centries, for economy, about 50 centries, for economy, about half of economy, about half, but not much, a little better.
Who does better than all?
Architects and engineers, thank you at the sky.
99 feet is the highest structure that I ever seen.
And why? Because they understand that triangles and the triangles and the models and the models are the key to build stable.
And then we have the general directors, a little better than the media.
But that's where it becomes interesting.
If you include a delegated amount of the delegated group can make a lot better.
This is incredible. It goes to be a little bit of the backstick at the group will win antic. And why?
Because they have particular ability in agevolving ability.
They exist the process, I understand it.
And all the groups who gesture and prestate attention to the work will improve the result of the team.
Some Does and the dots of agevolutation, and their combination to a success.
If you have 10 groups who usually well, you'll get structures that are going to get structures that are in the feet.
And I tried an interesting.
I thought, well, we get the wall.
I put on the 10,000 dollars in software.
What do you think about this students?
What was the result of it?
Here's what happened.
None of the team has created a stable structure.
If one of them had built a 2.5 house a 2.5 house to the premie.
Is it not interesting that a little bit of an impact?
We've tried to the new exercise with the same students.
What do you think this happened?
Now they had the value of a prototype.
The same team, from the worst has become the best.
They created the highest structure in the minute time.
So I'm importantly importantly about the nature of incentives and the success. You might say, why someone should spend time to write a marshmallow?
The reason is this: help to create digital instruments and processes to help build cars, video games.
And what makes a marshmallow is to help identify to identify supposed to identify supposed to identify supposed to identify supposes.
Why, every project has his marshmallow, is not like that?
The challenge provides a shared experience, a common language, a common language.
And so, this is the value of experience, of this simple exercise.
And those of you were interested in the marshmallowchallenge.com.
It's a blog where you can give a look at how marshmallow.
There are passes for step.
There are examples from all around the world about how people correct and sources the system.
There's also the record of the world.
And the most important, I think, is that design is really a sports of contact sport sport sports --
It requires the employments and the reasonments and the reasonments and the manuality to manuality to manuality the challenge that you have in a hand.
And a little prototype of this experience is everything that is necessary is everything that is necessary to transform a moment "ta-h-h-h-hy-hy-hy-hy-hythday --
And that can actually make a difference.
Thank you very much.
We ended up having a machine, beautiful machine, in TEDstyle style -- it's a time.
Everybody in this room have to go there.
You can go back, you can go back. You can't go back.
And I would be curious to know what to choose is, because I asked my friends in the last few times, and everybody want to go back.
I don't know. They don't want to go back to the cars or Twitter, or "American Idol."
I don't know.
I'm convinced that there is a kind of returns to our algies, illusions.
I understand.
But I don't do part of that group, I have to admit it.
I don't want to go back, and because I don't want to go back, and because the possibility on this planet doesn't go back, go away.
So I want to go into the machine and I want to go on.
This is the best time that there was on this planet in every field that we can measures, health, mobility, checks, mobility, opportunities, computers.
There was never a period like this.
My needs deeron, everybody before 60 years.
My grandparents spent that 70.
My parents are going to touch the 80s.
So it's better that there is a nine at the beginning of my years at my death.
But it's not just about people like us, it's a much bigger than this.
A child born in New Delhi today can be expect to live as much the richest man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it. It's an amazing.
How do we do that?
Vaiolo. The smallpox billions of people on this planet.
It has changed the demography of the global as no war has ever done.
If you went to Svanite.
We've disconfited.
In the rich world, disease that were mining millions of people only a generation ago, they basic.
Teat, rosolid poly; poly;
somebody knows what are we going to know?
Vaccine, modern medicine, our skills of feeding billions of people, these are triumps of scientific method.
And second me, the scientific method -- to try things and see if they work, to change when they don't work, is one of the great results of humanity.
These were the good news.
Unfortunately, they were the good news because there are other problems, and they were quoted a lot of times of times one of them is that, although everything we've got to get -- a billion people goes to read the fact that we have been read on this planet, every day.
This is growing is growing with amazing, and it's vergognow.
And not only that, we used our creativity to refill the planet.
It takes a little bit of the ground, groundary rainforests, oil forests, oil -- they're disappearing and they're disappearing out of this fall, and if we don't innow.
So the question is, can we can we do that? I think yes.
I think it's clear that it's possible to make food to feed billions of people without violent the earth that they live in.
I think it's possible to reform this world without that this energy world without that this distates.
I think I really, and no, it's not a illusion.
But here's the thing that I kept me wake up -- one of the things that keep me up at night.
We've never had as scientific progress as we need now; we have now. But we have never been in the position of how we could use them today.
We're at a step from incredible event, in many ambites.
But despite this, I think we should go back centuries, 300 years, first of the Illuminism, to find a period in which we fight the progress, a period where we have the more vigorous, a period where we have a vigorous time, than we do.
People intriguing in what they believe, and they do it with a lot of that we can't get it.
It turns out the truth of the truth.
You know, everybody has right now. They have right to their opinion; they also have right to the progress on the progress, but you know what you don't right?
You've got no right to your faces. I sorry, you can't.
I put it a little bit about it.
A decade of years ago, I wrote a story about vaccines for "The New Yorker," a short article.
And I was amazing someone opposed to what it is, after all, the most effectively effective of all the most effective of the human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I wrote the story, and I wrote the story and went to other.
Not much later, I wrote a story about genetically food --
Same thing, only bigger bigger.
People were crazy.
So I wrote a story about that, and I couldn't figure out why people were considered OGM as "most," because they thought that we could move the molecules in a specific way, instead of the molecules in a house of nature.
But, I wrote my job. I wrote the story and went on.
I mean, I'm a journalist: we send, sends up there.
But these stories were coming and I couldn't understand why, but at the end I did.
The problem was that that those fanatics were doing not fanatement.
They were consciousness, educated, people for well.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And the thing was a lot of --
But then I thought, we have to be honest; we're at a point, on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship with progress that there was a time.
We're going to talk to the environment.
We're talking to hythical terms using the virgolet: "Progres." Oh, well, there are reasons to do that, and I think we know what they are.
We've lost trust in institutions, in authority, and sometimes in science, and it's understandable that it's success.
You just do some names and people understand it.
Chernobnob-like Challenger, the Challenger, Viox, the massive destruction of mass, elections.
I mean, each one has his list.
We have questions and problems with people that we were thinking about it.
So you are skeptical.
Let's asked, you can pretend answers to it.
Don't you anything for granted.
But here's the foundation: when the evidence is necessary to accept them, and we're not very good at this.
And I think that the reason that we have in an epidemic of fear that I had never seen and hope I never saw and I hope I can't see it.
About 12 years ago, a story, orrible story, a horrible story that supported there was a bond between a wood epidemic, paroted and rosolia.
Very scary.
Hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true.
And they had to do hundreds of study; it's a important.
They came up with the data.
They came from the United States, from the U.S., from the Sweden, from Canada, and everyone were equal, no correlationship, no correlationship, no correlationship, no correlationship,
It doesn't make a difference. It didn't make it because we believe the aneddoes, to what we see -- to what we see -- to what we think we can see, what makes you feel real do.
We don't think about a pile of document documents of the government that show us all numbers, and we understand it everybody.
But you know what?
The results were devastated.
It's a must because this is a fact: The United States is one of the population in which the number of vaccines against death is caling more.
It's horrible, and we should be true.
It's awful.
What happened that happened that it is to do something like that?
Now, I understand. I understand it.
Think about it, someone here has the morning?
Somebody in the audience has ever seen a person die of death?
It doesn't happen.
In this country doesn't happen, but this happened 160,000 times in the world last year.
I'm a lot of deaths for death for dead, 20 every hour.
But since I don't have happened here, we can take it from your head and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around to shoot messages and ignorance messages like Oprah Larry King Live.
And they can do because they don't understand the difference between causality and correlationship.
They don't understand that these two things seem equal, but they're not almost mayor.
But it's something we have to learn it and we have to learn it quickly.
This man was a hero, Jonas Salk.
He has free the humanity from one of his fleors.
No suffering, no suffering -- the polyo, puff, it can -- disappear.
The man at the middle at the middle.
It's called Paul Offit.
It just created a vaccine against the rotable together, with other people.
She saved 400, 50,000 children every year in the developing countries.
Is it bad, right?
It's good, if it wasn't that Paul goes around to talk about vaccines, says how precious and people should just stop friends.
And it says in these terms of this.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul talks to a public evidence can't test testimonies without an arma.
They call it home because to some please remember them who know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul has created a vaccine.
I wouldn't need to tell you, but vaccines are fundamental.
If we stop taking them, the disease, disease back, terrible disease, and it's going on.
We have the new death in this country.
And it's going to be worse, and between not very much children will begin to die against numbers.
And they're not going to die of death.
Do you get that too. Why do you know?
One of my college of college wrote me a couple of weeks ago, and he said that was considered a little bit of it.
Nobody had told me before.
She wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't be walking on the polyo.
Again.
OK.
Why? Because there is no polio from us. But you know what?
We didn't have the polio in the United States.
I don't know. I -- maybe it's a guy of a guy is saliped on a airplane in Lagos Angeles, now is coming to L.A.
Maybe it will land in a couple of hours, will nothing a car, will be in the Long Beach and staser stasy of one of these fantastic cenvironmental cenvironment of these fantastic organized by TED.
He doesn't know that it was infected by a paralyzed disease, and we don't know because it's so that it works the world.
This is the planet that we live in. We don't do that it's not like this.
We're going to address. We're going to do it.
All of you have tains stay?
Echinacea, a bit of antiossidants to start the day.
I know you did it because Americans of Americans do it every day.
They take that stuff, as they cut up to the alternative medicine that are useful as often we are inexpensive to it.
The data demonstrate seeds.
They get the best urine. More of this doesn't do anywhere.
But it's good, you want to spend 28 billion dollars for school, are with you!
Urine school. Scoure.
Why?
I think we can understand, we oh the big pharmaceutical homes.
Let's great government machine machine. We don't figure.
And we do good. Our health system is going to do it.
It's cruel to millions of people.
It's absolutely incredibly cold, incredibly cold, and demoralizing for those of us that can afford it.
So do we get far away away from who?
We're going to be in the great placebo.
It's great. We love the great placebo.
You know, it's a serious problem because this stuff is a schip, and we spend billion dollars.
I have a whole series of examples.
None of these -- a from, a from, echinacea -- an echine -- I don't even know what it is but we spend billions of dollars, and it's a from.
You know what? When I say these things, people are going to read them, and they say "But what is interested in you?
It makes them well."
Do you me? You're going to go back.
Because I'm not interested in if it's the secretary of the Department for Salute and the Umani Umani Umani to say, "Uhm, I don't have to hear the evidence of the mammographics or if it says it says it says a few longer than the patients.
When we put the street that leads to replace science and evidence and evidence with magic and tradition, we end up in a place where we wouldn't be.
We start like Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
He killed 400 measures continuing to say that boats, slowing squarter-re-retrovirals that we know can slow the decort of the ancial drugs that we know can slow the decord.
Hundreds of thousands of deaths in a country that has been slower than every other one from this disease.
Please, you don't get to tell me that there are no consequences for these actions.
There are seeds. There are seeing.
Now, the largest epidemic epidemic right now is the war between the supports of genetically modified and the elite of genetically modified and the elite of biological food.
It's an idiatriba. It must end up there.
It's a diatriba, on the metaphors.
It's ideology, it's not science.
Every single thing that we eat, every chick of rise, every chick of price Bruxelles was modified by man.
See, there weren't sending in the Eden.
There were no money.
There were no Natal trees.
We've done it in the last 1111-year-old year-old.
Something worked and something else.
And we eliminated what it doesn't work.
Now we can do it more precise.
And there are risks, of course we are.
But we can insert things like vitamin As in the rise, and this would help millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people --
And we don't want to do it?
I have to tell you, I don't understand.
We're against OGM.
Why?
The things that I hear them: we too many chemicides, pesticides, monoculture, we don't want to be amount with the same thing, it's wrong.
We don't want that the companies to put short on life.
We don't want that companies are uniques in the seeds.
You know what my answer to this?
That's right. We're right. Let's do something.
It's true, we have a huge food problem, but it's not science.
It has nothing to do with science.
It's laws, morality line drives on shorts.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes gives you a positive result, but the idea that we should not afford to do its science to do because we have afraid to prosper.
You know, in the next 50 years, we'll be costly produced 70 percent of what we produce now, 70 percent of what we produce now, 70 percent.
These are the investments in Africa of the last 30 years.
Vergo.
They need and we don't need them to diam.
Why? Cibo genetically.
We don't want to encourage people to eat squarters like manioca.
Some billion people eat.
It looks a little bit like a little bit.
But it only provide calories.
It doesn't have no nutrients, it doesn't have proteins, but scientists are finding the way of inserters right now.
So a lot of people could eat less and run the risk of becoming sky.
They wouldn't die and you know what?
It would be very beautiful. It wouldn't be a restaurant, but it would be very beautiful.
I was a soluton: Why are we countered it?
I mean, do we ask the ocean: why are we stacking this thing?
Only why don't we want to move the genes and there?
It's about genes.
It's not about our holding obsession for the hours, or of our wish to have bigger much better food.
They don't get the Rice Krispies.
This is about saving people, and it would be that we begin to understand what it means to say.
Why do you want to know about it, and we keep behavioring it to behavior, we will be a lot of something that we don't think we want to be something that we don't think we want to argue about the technological colonialism.
There's no other way to describe what is going on.
It's egoist, it's horrible, it's horrible, and we have to stop it.
So, after this funny conversation of fun, you might say, "You still want to ask myself, "You still want to go into this ridiculous time and go to the future?"
Okay, of course.
It's block on the present now, but we have an amazing opportunity.
We can impose the machine of time as we want.
We have the possibility to go where we want, and we're going to get where we want.
We have to do these conversations, and we have to think, but when we go into the machine, and we're going to be happy to do it.
I know that we can -- I know that the world needs.
Thank you.
Thank you.
A day, the chronist of the Los Angeles Times Steve Lopez was passing on the streets of Los Angeles when he wrote a beautiful music.
It was from a man -- a man Afro-American Afro-American Afro-American, fascinating, with the marchers without dead, who was a violin that he had only two crows.
I'm telling a story that a lot of you know -- because the Steve articles of Steve Look in a book, which, in the followed to the great screen, with Robert Downew, with Robert Downeed, with Robert Lopez, and Jamie Fox, and Jamie Foxie in Nathony Ayers, the contrabts of the schief of the schief that was international by the schief of the schief of the schief of which was inter.
Nathaniel let me left Juilliard, he had a terrible nervous, and 30 years later lived as a without touch as a without the streets of Los Angeles.
I mean, all of you to read the Steve book to look at the film to look at the film to understand not just the beautiful tie that created between these two men,
I call Jane McGonigal. I'm a video games.
I realize games from 10 years, and my objective for the next 10 years, is to try to save the world in real life.
To make it a plan, and it convincing more people, I understood all of you, to spend more beautiful games and interesting.
We have three billion hours to play a week playing online.
Some of you might think, "It's a lot of time spent to play it."
maybe too time, considering how many of urgent problems we have to solve in the real world.
In fact, second my research research that I took the Istitute for Futuro, actually is the contrary.
Three billions of hours are not enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world.
In fact, I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet we have to increase that digneeds to increase that dig.
I calculated that the total that we need is 21 billion hours of play every week.
It's probably an idea-intuitive, so the repet, so the rest of the concept.
If we want to solve problems that fame, the climate change, the climate change, the obesity, the obesity, the obesity, I believe we have to have the environment, for at least 21 billions of hours a weard, for the next decade. No, are serious.
This is why. This picture is because I think that it's so important for the survival of the human species.
This is a portrait of the photographer Phil Toldan, he wanted to capture the emotion.
So he pictures of the players while they players players.
And this is an emotional classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classics.
If you're not used to be players that you losed some of this picture.
You probably notice the sense of urgence, a little bit of fear, but also a very profound concentration, a very deep attention to face a very difficult problem.
If you are used to notical players, you notice -- the folds around the eyes, and around the mouth are a sign of optimism.
And it turns them to get surprise.
This is a habital player to a step from one thing called "Epicaw."
Ah, it's a term that you heard. Okay. OK. Okay. OK.
So we have used today between us.
A vittory is a result so extraordinarily positive that doesn't seem to be possible until you can get it.
It's almost beyond the leap of the imagination, and when you get a shock discovering what you're really skill.
This player is at a epical player is at a epical player is at a epical player.
And this is the expression we need to see on the fact that we need to see on the world of a problem in the world while we face the obstacles of someone which, against all the expression of someone which, against all the expression of someone which, against all the expression of someone which.
Unfortunately, this is the expression that we see in the life of all the day-while we face to deal problems.
This is the expressure we call "Brate Nella Realty. And I'm going to do it.
I am with the expression, "I'm not Bry."
This is a grafferent in my old Berkeley, in California, where I did the PhD in California, where I did PhD in real life.
And this is a lot of lots of abits: we feel that we are not good as good as in games.
And I don't mean simply like success -- even though the successful one of the success is going to get more results in online.
But I mean, "good good at the sense of motivates to do something important, inspired to collaborate and cooperating.
And when we are in a wonline world, I believe that many of us become the best versions of themselves to help without prevantaggery to help without prevent on a problem for the entire time, to get up after a failure and try new new thing.
And in the real life, when we face a failure, when we face a obstacle, we often not feel like that we feel like that we feel like that we feel anxious, maybe depressed or Chinic.
We're not going to try and feel these feelings while game, simply not there in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study to university.
What is in a game is that in a game that we can't get any results that we cannot get any result of it?
How can we transport those feelings and applying them into the real?
So I studied a games like World of Warcraft, which is really the ideal environment to solve problems in collaborative maniery.
And I began to notice some things that make the epic lives so possible in online.
The first is, when you open up in one of these games online, especially in World of Warcraft, there are lots of different characters that flower to save the point that you have a mission to save the world.
But not a mission any mission: a perfectly mission in the game. Right?
So you can complete.
They will never give you an impossible.
But it's at the limits of skills. So you have to try seriously.
But there is no disoccupation in World of Warcraft, you don't spend time to turn the pollens, there's always something specific and important to do.
And there are many collaborators.
All right, hundreds of thousands of people, ready to join your epical mission.
It's not something that is so common in real life, this sense that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there is this narrative epic, this narratives that inspiratives that inspirative -- and what we're doing.
And then we remember this positive feedback positive --
You've heard about increasing level and forces -- one of a force, and intelligence.
We don't receive that kind of constants in real life.
When I leave this stage is not going to have a Please in front of an audience, and a pleasure of a bizarre ideas --
I didn't get that kinds of feedback in real life.
Now, the problem of collaborative online like World of Warcraft is that it gives so much satisfaction is that it gives to a liver from a liver life. All our time in these games.
It's just better than reality.
This is for that, end, collectively all of the World Warcraft have spent 5.93 million years to solve the virtual problems of Azeroth.
This is not necessarily thing negative.
But put it in perspective -- 5.93 million years ago was the time where one of our ancestors had been topped up in the planet in the plan.
That was the first one walking walking her.
Okay, so when we talk about how much time we invest in play, the only manier-sensory of thinking about them, is to talk about the human evolution of human evolution, which is also useful, but also useful, because we discovered that we're changing what we're going to do we change what we're going to be as human human evolved to collaborate more heart.
This is true, I believe.
So you know this statistics.
It was published by a Carnagie Mellon.
The typical young medium today in a country in a country with a stronger culture of players will have spent 10,000 hours playing online, at the age of 21 years.
10,000 hours is an interesting number of two reasons.
First of all, for the children in the U.S. 10.080 hours is the exactly number of hours to school maturity if you're present every day.
So we have a whole whole parallel of education in which young people learn how to be the player to school players; parallel to schools where they learn the whole thing.
And some of you have probably read the new of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuoriclasse."
If you have read it of its successful theory of successful, the 10,000 hours for success.
It's based on a good research in the cognition, that if we dedict 10,000 hours of study fruitous phruttuous at the age of 21 years of genes in that field.
We'll be good at that something as much the best people in the world.
So what we have now now now is a whole generation of young people.
So the question is, "Exattly, what become bad bad these playing?"
because if we could understand what this is we would have a human-resources of human resources.
This is the number of people in the world that are at least one day to play online.
These are our genes of game.
500 million people who are extraordinary -- in something.
And in the next decades we have another billion of habital players that are extraordinary.
If you didn't know it, this is what expected to us, this is what the video games is developing platforms that consumed power that consumes power and work with the cell phones that are players of the Internet in India, particularly players around the world, in India, China, Brazil, China, Brazil can connect online.
The estimate is a billion players in the next decade.
This is going to take us 1.5 billion players.
So I started thinking under what these games are transforming into genes.
These are four expects I have individuals. The first is a very good urgent
Okay. Think it as a extreme of self-motivation.
A optimism is the desire to immediately face to deal with a obstacle with the convinction of having a reasonable of success.
The abitual players believe that a victory is possible and it is possible and that it always has the pend of trying to make it right now.
The habital players are not with the hands.
Ahabital players are virtuous virtuous with a social trame.
There are a lot of interesting research that show how we find better with other people after played with them, even though they were playing with themselves.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with someone -- we trust that are going to go through the same rules and with the same rules and obbirds and with the same rules and obbirds and the same obbig.
So, to play together with builds the bonds of the confidence and cooperation.
And the result that we really have more social social relationships.
I mean, a joyful productivity.
You know, there is a reason that the World Warcraft player 22 hours a week, almost as a part-labor work.
It's because we know, while we're playing -- that we actually play, and more happy working on -- and rather than we are playing, or losing time.
We know that we are optimized, as a human, to work sounds like being human, to work with.
And used to work on the habital players are dispoundly, if it's a adapt task if it's a adapt tas.
Finally, an epic means.
The habitual players adoring to be associated with wonderful human stories on the planetary scale of planetary scale of planetary carian scale of planetary climbers.
For example, a little information to help create a context.
You know Wikipedia, the biggest wiki in the world.
The second wiki biggest wiki in the world, with almost 80,000 articles is the World of Warcraft China.
They have skilled more information on World of Warcraft in the Internet, that any other argument in any other wiki in any other wiki in the world.
They're building a epicture of it.
They're building a source of information source in World Warcraft.
Okay, these are the four superpowers that together.
Ahabital players are individuals of great optimism of super-powers.
These are people who believe that they are individually skills to change the world.
The only problem is that believed to be able to change the virtual worlds but not real.
This is the problem I'm trying to solve.
There is a economy of Edward Castronova.
Her studies are brilliant. She's studying reason why people invested so much time, energy and money, in online.
He says, "We're looking at what it is nothing that is nothing that a mass exodd exodd to the worlds and the environments.
And it's a economy, so it's rational and says -- -- not like me, I'm a playing project of games, I'm exuberant.
But he says -- he saw that this is a perfectly sensory, because the used players can get more in the world's world's players in real life.
They can have more solid social relationships in a game that not in real life.
They have a better feedback and feel more feeling feeling more reward in a game that not in real life.
So, I saw now, it's perfectly reasonably reasonable players in the real world that in the virtual world that in the real world that this is reasonable to agree that this is reason for now but it's not, in a way, a situation situation of the world that we have to start the real world more similar with a game.
Here's a tragging from something that happened 2500 years ago.
These are days of ancient host of Prima to have a joysticks and butting wonderful bones and bones that we had looked at sheep of sheep.
If you know the ancient of the ancient historical written history.
It's the story of who invented games and why.
And I was born that plays, particularly the games of the game of the Lidia, during a period of the Lidia, during a period of a caresty.
She was so several was so several that the Lidia decided to do something impensible.
People suffering, the population was at the end of the extreme -- they need a extrema.
So, second Erodot, they invented the days and emanded a valid laws around the regulation.
One day, everybody would have eated.
The next day everybody would have played.
And they diving so profoundly in the game of the playing is so involved and that involved us in a game, that they ignored the fact that they didn't eat the fact that they have nothing to eat.
And so one day they playing, and a day eat.
And second Erodot, they smooted 18 years old, surviving a day and playing the follow.
I think that's exactly the way we use today.
We use games to get to sleep to get to the real world of the real world.
We use games to get away from everything that doesn't work in our real-environment, from everything that doesn't work in our real life, and get what we need from the games.
But we don't need to stop here.
This is really interesting: second Erodot, in 18 years, the caresty was not going to be better about it, so the decided that they would played a last wall.
They were beyond the whole realm of the game in a day-wall, and the winner.
They let up the Lidia and they went to look at a new earth where to live, leaving the number of people to survive with the resources of people to survive with the resources of their civilization somewhere, where else you could have their civilization somewhere, where you could prosper.
Is it a little idea idea, right?
But it turns out of the DNA revealed that the Etrusks who would have been brought to the roman, shared the same DNA of the Lidia.
So the scientists have suggested that the story of Erodote is a real story.
And geologists have found evidence of a global raffee that it almost 20 years and that could explain the caresty.
So this amazing story might be true: they could have saved their culture playing, refugee in the games for 18 years to be so inspire as well as well as well as well as I met as well as well as the whole civilization.
Okay, we can do it.
We're at World of Warcraft from 1994.
And it was the first game of strategy in real time of the World Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
They played by 18 years, we played Warcraft for 16 years.
And I say, we are ready for our epic game for our epic go.
They would work out half of the population of the population of a new world.
This is where I trage the idea of 21 billion hours of play a week.
We make half of us to agree that half of us to play a day to play a day to play, until the problems of the real world.
Imagine what you're going to ask, "How do we solve the problems of the real world in a game?" Well, that's what I said I had my job in a game?" Well, this is what I dedicated the Futuro.
In our own Palo Alto we have this stendaries our idea of how we should relate to our idea of how we should relate to the future.
We don't want to predict the future.
And what we want to do is to realize -- the future.
We want to imagine the scenaries from the best results and then we want to give the possibility to transform them in reality.
We want to imagine lives to make epic epic epic to make them.
I'm going to show you three games that I realize that I realized and I'm a attempt to create of the epic lives to create epic lives in their future.
This is "Mondwell."
We did this game in 2007.
It's a online play in which you look at a load of oil.
It's not real, but we published sufficient online to make believing that it is, and to make life as if we were at the side, and to make life like if we were at the game -- you know, when you enter in the play -- and you have news that area of you, and dopod-data that show exactly the cost of the oil distribution. The things that are not available, the impact of food distribution of food distribution.
If there are impact on transportation, if the schools are closed, and you have to think about how you live your life, and you have to think about how you live your life if that was real. And you have a blog on a blog on a shot of a blog --
We had this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we looked at them for the three years, and what I can say is that transform.
No one wants to change the maniera in which lives because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a should do it.
But if you dive them in an epic adventure and says, "We've got no longer oil and says, "We've got no longer oil and says, "We've got no longer oil.
This is an incredible story about it. A adventure to which you can participate it.
Shy: Shimself to see how to survive."
Most of our players who has learned in the game.
So, for the next thing I want to save the world, we decided to save the world, we decided to a higher problem than oil.
We did a game called Superperstruct, at the Istitute for Futuro, and the premise was, a supercomputer has calculated that humanity has only other 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputer was called "The Global of Allerte Estination of the Global Estination.
We've asked people to reach online almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer's movie.
You know Jerry Bruckheimer's films of a dream, I have a dream, and scientist, the astronauta, scientist, and everybody else to save the world, but in our game, but in our game, instead of having a five people in the squarter, and it's a dream, and it's a dream of the energy of the energy and the future of resource and the future of security and the future of security and the future of security and the future and the future.
8,000 people played for eight weeks and have generated 500 solutions that you can find if you go online and look for Google "Superperties --
Finally, the last game, the last three of marze. This is a three of marzing played with the Istitute.
If I completely played the game of the World Bank, like the Social Innovator of the 2010.
Loring with university university disappears for sub-Saharan Africa, we're inviting them to learn the social techniques.
There is a story of comics, you increase level of levels like local knowledge, sustainability, the imagination.
To invite all of you to share this guy with young people, wherever in the world, particularly in the developing areas of the developing areas of the development that they could benefit to save the world.
It's now to conclusion.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think what happen?
We have all of these amazing players, we have these games that are projects of what we could do is, but no one of these has still saved the real world.
Well, I hope that you agree with me that I agresource that we can use to make a human resource that we can use to do the real world that players are a powerful platform that we have these incredible superpowerful superpowerful protectivity that we have these incredible superpowerful resource of a epic meaning epic means of a epic means.
I really hope that we can be met to play games that are important, to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that you join me in the realize and participatterns like this.
When I look at the next decade, two things are certainly, two things are certain: we can do anything we can imagine, and we can play anything we want to play anywhere we want.
So, I say -- we let's do the play that will change the world.
Thank you.
For some time I was interested in placebo, it can look like a strange thing that a magician effect of it, unless you consider that you don't look at the point of view is a reality of the way to become something realong to become something reality in other words, the pills. In other words, the sugar effect in some studies, the effect thinks
which is happening is to have to be a drug or something like --
The pain of the pain, for example, if they believe that we have a measurable effect in the body called the placebo.
Something is true for perception that if you have.
So to figure that I want to show you a magic trick very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that is present in all the books for children in the field.
I learned from only with Cub Sco-Magic Scout.
And so I'll be experimented to you and explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I explained.
This is what happens.
The color, you can examinate; my hand you can examine.
I'm just going to turn the slides in my pug, like this.
I was up on the hand.
To be safe that nothing is or saving from my hand.
Now weird my poly-like this.
And so you can see that something that you ever see something that can go on or down to my hand.
And the purpose of that is simple.
I go to open up my hand, and if everything has gone good, my magnetism is going to be the cold.
In fact, it remains that I can school that I can school, and the color doesn't fall.
Nothing goes on or down from my hand.
There's no trick. You can examine anything.
Ta-da!
This is a trick that often intuition to the children.
that are interested in the magic because you can learn a lot about the ingage of the ingage of the ingage of this is very simple.
Many of you in this room will know this trick.
This is what I think is happening in my hand.
I say that I saw my wright.
to make sure that anything saves or from my man, this is a good thing.
The reason why I'm keeping the pole is because it's the secret of illusion.
In the moment when my hand moves away from you, this fingtandoses here, my indeed here, my indeed, he shoulder, in a position.
There's somebody who didn't have a childhood.
That's from here, from here, right.
And when I turn the finger is moving.
We can talk about why it's sunning, because you don't notice that there are just three fingers down because the mind, and the way with which is information not contain, one, two, three.
But that's not the point. Right? And when I open my hand, Of course, stayed not through the animal magnetism,
And when I close my finger, same thing, when I walk back, this movement takes the finger that movement.
It turns out the hand.
It's a trick you can do with your friends and close. Thank you.
Now, what has to do with the placebo?
I read a study, a year ago, a year ago that I read the mind.
I'm not a medical researcher, for which was a surprising.
It looks like that if you look at a placebo in the form of a white pill, made like a white aspill, just a white pill, a white pill, has a measurable.
But if you change the shape and you give the placebo, in the form of a smaller pill, and blue printed a literally more effective.
Even if no one of the two has no drug -- they're crawls of sugar.
But a white pill, the white pill.
What? It really until it.
But by the way, it's not here that it goes up.
The capsules are more effective than every form.
A capsule of the colored one hair, which is a resist of a capsule.
The dosage has a rolean has a roly.
A couple two times a day is not as effective like three pills. Now I don't remember the statistics.
But the point is,
-- that these dosages have a role-up.
And it also has a role-like shape.
And if you want to use a definitive you have to use a ago.
Right? A syringe with something -- a couple of a couple of a inert of an inert.
You start it in a patient --
This is a strong image so strong in their mind, much stronger than the white pill.
It's real, this graphics -- I'm going to show you another time when we have slides.
The point is that the white pillle is not effective like the blue that is not effective how the cape that is not as a ago.
And no one of these has a drug quality.
It's just your believing that makes them in your cover and raphforce the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and applying it to a magic trick.
And do something that is a trick and make it seems to be real.
And we know from the study that when you want to use the ago.
This is a seven inchicks, Molyards --
The sterilist a while.
This is my meat. This is not a special Cark.
This is my skin. This is not a special hollywood.
I'm going to bucket my skins and to go this ago to the oppoint.
If you tried nauseful -- if you get easily -- I did for a few friends in the trego, the other night, and for some of the woman is almost slame.
So if you try nauseful easy, I suggest that you don't look for the next 30s -- in fact, I'm going to do the first bad part of here.
You can see, you can see, you can see from another part.
This is what happens, right here, the beginning of my arm at the lowest part of my arm, I just do a little bully.
Do you use it?
And now a little across my skin, and out the other hand, like this.
Now, we're in the same position that we were with the knife.
More or now? But you can't contact my fingers right now?
So you have the most. Here two three, four, five --
I know what people looks when you see that,
They think, "Sically, it's not going to be stupid to buck up with a few minutes.
So, let me give you a squarter.
Are you going to be good.
Yeah, I know that there are behind "Okay, I don't saw it well."
People in the rooms are wrong.
Let me show you close.
This is really my skin. It's not a special effect of Hollywood.
This is my carne, and I can turn it around it.
Sorry, if you feel bad about another part, you look at another part, you don't look at all.
People in the bottom or will say, "Well, it's clear, it's clear that it was clear that trigger some effect, but if it was true.
You can see a hole here and a hole here, if it was true blood here, if it was true blood --
Well, I'm going to go out a little bit of blood for you.
Here's here.
And I don't want to leave the ago.
I would like my arm, and I would like to see that there are not hurted.
But I believe that in this context and the idea of taking something fake and turn it into something true, and I'll let it should be -- and I'll go from the stage.
We're going to see different in the next day. I hope you can't see the now. Thank you very much.
So, in my life, I met a lot of fish.
I just loved it only two.
The first one of a passional story.
It was a beautiful fish setly. It was one of the sames on the menu.
That weight!
But even better than a better farming farmed standards of the sandard of environmental standard of the environmental standard.
So you feel like to be a place with consciousness to sell.
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for different months.
A day, the head of the company called me and asked me to talk about a dedicated event of the environmental sustainability of training.
"Of course I said, "Oh, of course.
This was a company that he was trying to solve what he was a unimaginable problem for our cheap.
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu?
During the last 50 years we have weighed in the same way we have sentence.
The destruction has been tremendous.
90 percent of the great fish, the ones that we like so much tonn, the halibut, the halibut, the sunlides, the slides are drastically reduced number of number of number of number of of number of numbers.
There is almost nothing about it.
So, we like to do or less water or less water of the fish of our future.
There are a lot of arguments.
The crawings of the fish, for the least most of themselves, and they're inefficient. You take the ton for example.
A great problem is that there is a food of a 15 to one.
This means that it means that it takes 15 wild wild fish to get a book.
It's not very sustainable.
And the knows is not a great challenge.
Here's here here here was a company that was trying to do it in the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The first one of the event I telephone car of the public audiences.
Let's call it Don.
"Don," I said, "How much to figure you to get famous to do so far away in the away that you don't pollut."
"Exact," he said, "We're so far away from our shot that our scarts are diluits, not concentration."
And then add "We practically a world in particular world.
"The rate of conversions? 2.5 to a hood."
"The best in sector."
2.5 to one, fantastic.
"2.5 to something? What do you eat to fish?"
"The sustainable protein say.
"Great," I said, "Look yo.
The night, I was at night, I thought, I think, but it slide is a sustainable protein it?
So the next day I was first of the event, I called Don.
I said, "Don, do you have some examples of sustainable protein s?"
He said I didn't know it, and he would be asked around around here.
Well, I talked to a little bit about the company, and no one to give me an answer.
And until I talk to the biologist.
We also him Don.
"Don," I said, "Do you have some examples of sustainable protein s?"
Well, he mentioned a few algalg algae and then he said, "People of the pollo."
And I said, "People of pollod?"
She said, "Yeah, thought, sand bong, sweat, sliced and processed to eat."
I said, "What's the percentage of your eat is made of pollo?"
I think, say, the two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent."
And I said, "Don, what is this is sustainable in the fishing of the pollo to eat?"
There was a long pauses on telephone and then said, "There are just too chickens in the world."
I sweaving this fish.
No, because I'm not one of those virtuous virtuous amount of the good food.
Well, to say that truth. I are.
No, in fact, I disamount of this fish because, I want to do it after that conversation, the fish.
The second fish is a different love.
It's a story that is a story of the story that the fish and the most knowledge.
I eat him for the first time in a restaurant, in the south of the Spaper.
My friend of my journalist on this fish.
She had done us met to met us.
He came to the table had a brilliant white color, almost swimming.
The chef had taken it too much.
Spindoubles how it should be cotted.
It was very unbelievable.
Who is able to make a good fish so good after having this street?
I mean, but this guy yes.
Let's call Miguel.
It's actually called Miguel.
No, it didn't have the fish, and it's not a cheap.
For lessly, not in the sense that we mean by it.
It's a biologist in Veta biologist, which is a weigh of the Spain of Spain to the Spain to the Spain to the Spain to the Spain of the riume of the river.
As the '80s, the early 80 the crows.
And they had become on what before was essentially was a paludox area.
They had giving the earth building a series of convolved with the water in the river.
Well, they couldn't make it works out what not from the economic point of view.
And, from the ecologic view was a disaster.
He had killed something like 90 percent of the birds and watching the place, it's a lot of birds --
So in 1982 a spagno-like company with a consciousness compared with the ground.
What do they do?
They invert the flow of water.
Literally, they invert the switches.
Instead of the water of the water came out of the earth used the channels.
They all start all the channels.
They realized a fishing of fishing out of 27 miles spigs, rangers and crybers and in this process, Miguel and this company, Miguel and this company --
The farming is incredible.
I mean, you never saw a thing like this.
Look at the horizonte that seems to be a million miles and everything that you see are the inones and this recognize and this recognize.
I was there little time ago with Miguel.
This is an amazing three quart quarter Charts Darwin and a quarter Crocode Dundee.
Okay? We're made in the middle to this lague, I had the fanger and I had the game to the knea's knea's lesson of biology.
First of a white nest.
And then it explain the fitos of the fitoplankton and fish sets that remember the giraffes that remembers the Tanzania.
It turns out out that Miguel has spent a lot of the National Park in Africa.
I asked them how it was becoming a fish.
She said, "You know what? I don't know about fish.
I'm a relationship in relationship."
And he was going to launches up still on the rare along waters.
Don't well well all this was very fascinating, which is, one thing like biotic community.
He's interesting, but I was in love with it.
And my head was continuing to think about that deliptious fish.
So the interrupts and I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish so good fish so good fish so good fish it?"
He indicated the algae indicated the algae.
"I know, the algae, the fitoplankton, the relationships, yes, it's incredible.
But your fish what are they eat?
What's your food rate conversion of food conversion?
Well, it answers to me how they would be a rich system so rich that the fish eat exactly what they would send exactly what they would send in a wild environment.
The biomass of plants, the stoplankton -- that's all of the fish.
The system is so in health that is completely self-innove system.
There are no eat.
You've ever heard of a farming that is not giving to eat his animals?
More later, I was driving around the earth with Miguel and I said, "In a place like this looks so natural like this looks like like so natural so any of any farming that has ever seen to measure the success?"
In that moment, it was like if the regist of a film had the change of the set.
And we looked at the corner and we saw a scene between the most incredible thousands and thousands and thousands of phencopters of a hand-a-a-house realized that he had to lost eye.
"That's the success," he said, "That's successful successful.
"Look to their bloods.
They're bank you.
Bancheck? I was completely confuse.
I said, "Miguel, but they're not banching with your fish?"
"Yeah.
"Why we have about 20 percent of the fish and fish for the bird of the bird.
So last year on this properties there were 600,000 birds over 250 species.
Today has become the biggest and one of the most important healthy healthy biggest birds in the Europa."
And I said, "Miguel, but a population reports of bird bird is not the last thing you would like to be in a fish?"
SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSD.
He said, "We're going to get extensive in a very extensive.
This is a ecologic network --
The phencopters eat the legs.
The legs are eating snarrows.
So it's so much better is the system."
Okay, then we would be swallowed to eat his animals and that measures his success in the health of its predators.
It's a fish, but also a health care for bird.
Ah, at the way, those phenicopter they shouldn't even be.
They make the nests in a 150 miles where the soil conditions of the soil conditions of the best conditions.
Each morning, they flying for 150 miles and get to the flies and they get to the 150 miles for the back.
They do it because they're able to follow the white line, white line of the A92.
On the seriously.
I would imagine something like Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, they flying for 150 miles to farming and then 150 miles of night to go back?
Do they do it for their small?"
He looked at me how if I had just quoted a song of Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, do it because the food is improve."
I didn't talk about the skin, I didn't talk about my fish, and I usually don't like the skin.
I don't like a haban: I don't like cry.
It's that knowledge, as of asphalt.
Not the kitself.
And yet, when I asked it in the south of south Spain of Spain of the Spainting of the skin.
He had a sweet sweet and cleaned was like giving an ocean.
And I said to Miguel, and he annued.
He said, "The skin is like a spug.
This is the last defense that any thing you walk in the fish.
It's evolved to hold the impurity."
And then add "But our water has no impurity."
Okay. A fly that doesn't feed his fish.
A food that that measures its predators.
And then I realized that when he says that he says that the water is not very minimizing the water that fluid in that fluid in that that fluid is a river, which is a river, which is a river, which is a river, which is a rivers that the rivers are tending on chemical skeeps of pesticides.
And when it goes down the system, and the water is clean than when it's good.
The system is so in healthy, that can water.
So, not just a farming that doesn't only have to feeding animals not just a farming that measures his success in the health of his predators and health of his predators and not just for those fish and not just for those fish and not just for those fish, but also for you.
Because when water water goes in the Atlantic water.
This is a drop in the ocean, but I know the well, and so you should be able to do why romantic love for how romantic love is also instructive.
It could say it's a recipe for the future of good food is that fish is that weighs of bovines.
And what we need is a radically new agriculture of agriculture in which food has really good know.
But for a lot of people, this is a little too radical thing.
We're not realists, passionate of food.
We're love.
We put the little agricultural markets.
We put the little familiar farmers.
We talk about local food.
We eat biologic.
And when I say these are the things that make sure the future of good food and says, "Hey, you know, "Hey, you also have a food food and says, "Hey, even to me like you think, but how do you think we could feed the entire world to feeding the entire world that?
How do you think we can feed the world?"
Can I be main?
It's a question I don't like it.
No, because we produce not because we produce enough to feed the world.
A billion people suffering the hunger today.
One billion -- more than we have ever -- because of the huge of the huge ges in the distribution.
See, I don't like this question because he determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years.
From cereals to the pestics to the monocultures, chemicals to the chickens to the fish, and all this period of the agricultural industry has just asked "If we could feed more people in economic ways, what are we going to do.
This was the motivation.
It was the justified.
It was the business of business of the American agriculture.
We should call it for what it is, an industry that is a liquid industry that is fastly erod-erodd industry that makes a possible.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our panimal today is not because of the provided in declines but for the resources in declined not for the last invention for the last invention of the earth of fertile, not for the pumps, but for the fresh water not for mocket and not for the fresh of the fresh and not for the weighs, but for the forest in the sea.
Do you want to feed the world?
Let's start asking ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that connect to every local communities to feed?
To do that, we don't look at the model of the future.
It's a model and stank.
And it all over capital, chemistry and machines, and it never really produced anything good for eat.
Instead, we look at the ecological model.
This is what contains about two billion years of the work.
Let's look at Miguel, at allevators like Miguel, and farm that are not closed in if they have no world's disease that rebuild instead of consumption that they have extensively instead that only extensively instead of that only instead of that only experts in relationships, because they are the people who are also experts in the knowledges in know.
If I have to be truly chef best chef than I can ever be I.
You know, at me good, because if that is going to be the future of good food, it's going to be deliver.
Thank you.
I grew up with a further base diet of phantom.
At high high school -- I took a school hours and back every day.
And I was always immersed in a book of science book, which was bringing my mind in other worlds, and satisfaced in the narrative form, that insatic insity that I had --
And that curious curiosity was also in the fact that every time I wasn't at school out in the wood, excursions to hunters, naks, insects and snails, insects and seats and seats -- I brought them to the microscope.
I was a real geek of science.
But it always was trying to figure the world, understanding the limitations.
And my love for phantom, in reality seemed to be respect the world around me, because what was going on in the earth 1960s, we were going to go on the moon, we were going to explored the depth of the oceans, Jacques Cousteau in our saves with his amazing animals and places that showed us wouldn't have to imagine.
So it seemed to make my passion for science.
And I was an artist.
I knew to draw. I knew painting. I knew painting.
And since there were no video games in the middle of film generated to computer, or all of these pictures in the media, I had to create these pictures in my head.
From a children, when we read a book, we all had to put something on the screen on the screen of our tests.
And so, my answer was painting aliens, the alien creatures aliens, robots, robots, navicells and spaces, all this stuff.
The lessons of mathematical lessons I was becceded to behind the textbook.
This is because creativity had to find a while.
And it happened to be interesting: The Jacques of Jacques Cousteau was involved that there was an alien world right here on the earth.
Maybe you never go to a alien world on a alien world on a spacal space.
It was very unlikely to be unlikely to be unlikely.
But that was a world where I could go to true, right here on the rich and exotics of what I would ever imagine that I would ever imagine,
So, I decided that I would become a subjector of 15 years.
And the only problem was I living in a little country in a little country in the small of the closest ocean.
But I didn't left to go down.
And I had my father until he found a school of immers' in Buffalo, New York, I just spend the confinishing where we live.
And so I was able to take the certified in a YMCA in the Find in Buffalo, New York.
And I wouldn't seen the ocean, for two years, until we moved in California.
Since then, in the last 40 years, I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater and 500 of these hours in submersibles.
And I learned that the depth of the ocean, even the deep oceans, are rich of life that really goes to the way of our imagination.
The imagination of nature is without confines of our human imagine.
Again, I'm intimacy from what I see when I do the immersions.
And my love story with the ocean continue to the ocean, more than it was ever before.
But when I choose a career, I choose to make film.
It looked like to be the best way to concilize this smany to tell stories with the smania to create imagines.
And, from a guy, I designed cost and so on.
So to make film was the only way to put together and stories.
Everything came back.
And of course the stories I chose to tell were phants of phantom: "Aliens," "Aliens" and "The Aliens" and "The Abys."
And with "The Abys" I universe my love, and the immers with the realization of a film.
So, I got the two passions.
From "The Abys" came out something interesting that was solving a narrative specific problem in that film, which is create that kind of a creature of liquid water creature -- we adopted the animation of the computer.
And so he was the first person to the early surface and animated to the computer that was ever seen in a film.
And even though the film doesn't have a lot of money, I would say that to malape was repair of something extraordinary -- all the audience, all the audience, all the audience.
You know, it's the law of Arthur Clarke for which every technology officiently advanced by the magia.
They were seeing something magic.
And that emotioned me a lot.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is something that has to be adopted in the film.
So with "Terminator 2," my next film -- my next film --
And in Like with the Industrial Light and Magic, we created the guy of metal sliquid in that film. The success.
And it worked. And we have a magic.
And we got the same result with a audience.
But we had a little bit more with that film.
So, by by by by taking a line between these two points, I came to the conclusion that this would be a whole new world of creativity for the Chema.
So I put up a society with a society with Stan Winston, my hamic friend Ston, who was the principal trick and designers in that period, and we called it Digital Digital Digital Domain.
And the principle of society was to let us to the past, the analog press opties and so forth, and you go directly to the digital production of digital production.
And so we did it and given us a competitive advantage for a while.
But we were left back to half of the '90s in the 1990s in the '90s, which is what we had founded the society.
So I wrote this text called "Avatar" with the intenance of pinger to the multiple of visual computers, with the humans and realistic characters and realistic characters and realistic characters and the whole world generated to computer-generated computers.
And the whole thing was stay to the mythic.
The guys of the society said that we weren't going to be able to do it for a little bit.
So I slipped it and I did this film of a big ship that has a big narrowd that has a big narrowds.
I looked at this study there as a "Romeo and Giuliet and Giuliett."
It would be a epicture of epic, a passional movie.
Segretly, what I wanted to do was to immergery to see the relittle.
That's why I did that film.
And it's truth. I didn't know.
But I convine. I said, "We're going to immerge it to the network. We're going to get it from alive.
We're going to use it for the beginning of the film.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a fantastic."
And I convinced them to financial expedition.
It looks like crazy. But this brings back to the imagination that it makes reality.
Because we really created a reality and six months later I found on a Russian and a half of depth in North Atlantic Atlantic from the Atlantic, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in the definition, but for real.
I was stuck sleep.
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build Child and a lot of other things.
But I was flowed by those deep deep, it was like a space mission of space.
where everything was highly technical and rechieded huge planning.
You put it in this capture, you go down in this hair, where there are no hope to be saved to be saved, from which you can't go back to itself.
And I thought, "Fantastic. This is how to live in a science movie.
It's really amazing."
And so, I was from the depth of the exploration of the depth of the ocean.
Of course, curiosity, scientific component.
It was all. It was well.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't offer me.
Of course I could imagine a creature and create a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I saw out of the god.
In our afterwards of our expeditions, I've seen creature hydrothermal -- I had never seen before, things that no one had ever seen before, that no one has ever seen before, that actually weren't even described by science to the science that we had to seen up the science that we had been seen up with science at that we saw up with the science.
So I was all about this and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "Okay, I'm going to put my day-regist of Hollywood, and I do the explorer for a little bit of a while.
So we started to planning these expeditions.
We found out of the Bismark and exploring it with robotic vehicles.
We went back to the Titanic.
We took little robots that we had created with the optical fiber.
And the idea was to go inside and make a surprising within the ship, which was never done.
Nobody had ever looked at the inside of the relittle, so we created the technology to do it.
So I was at the Titanic, sitting in a market of the Titanic, looking at the asks that seem like these, where I knew that they had sounded violinists.
And I'm driving a little robotic vehicle through the corridom of the ship.
When I say that, I'm driving, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically present within the Titanic.
And it was the experience dejudence that has ever lived as a real-lived because I had already before I had to turn the corner of the spacection of the vehicle of the vehicle of the film.
And the set was based on a replicity of the ship.
So it was an absolutely amazing experience.
And it really really realized that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experiment experiment that you can experimented in the vehicle of existence.
It was very deep deep there.
And it might be a little bit of what may be going to happen between some decadecade when we start to have cybick for the explorations or other reasons in some kinds of the future that I can imagine, from the science that I can imagine, from the science.
So we did these expeditions, and it really started to appreciate what there was subt, like the open of the depth of the depth of the ocean animals.
And it is basically aliens here on the earth.
They living in a chemosynthesis --
They don't survive in a system based on the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight of the sunlight.
So, you see animals that live close to water water at 500 degrees centers.
It even seems to be impossible that there is lots of it.
I was interesting a lot of space science of space science, one again, is the flu of the science, from girl.
And I ended up in the space environment with NASA, sitting in the consultive of NASA, to planning space in Russia, to plan biomedge of the pre-cost biomedy of the pre-cosmonauty, and all of these things, and all of these things, until to the international spacal station with our 3D.
It was fascinating.
But what I finished to do was to bring the space scientists,
And bring them down because they could have access -- -- astrobiologist, scientists, people interested in these extreme environments to these extremendous extremendous extremendous and so on.
So we were turning documentars, but we actually had science, and space science, space science,
I had closed the race between being phantom fan of phantom, to do those things to real.
And you know, during this path of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot of science. But I also learned a lot about leadership.
Everybody thinks that a register has to be a leader, whatever.
I didn't know anything about leadership before to do all those expeditions.
Why do I have to say, "What am I going to do I have to say, "What am I going to do that?
Why am I doing? What do I remember?"
You can't make all these spectacles.
We have bad in part.
People almost people think, I went to "Titanics" and "Avatar" and that I was spring pollen.
I did all these film, all of these film, all of these documentary for a public record.
No family, no glory, no glory, what?
I am doing it for the task of the challenge -- and the ocean is the biggest challenge that there is the biggest challenge that you instance, and for the brilliance of people form a team profoundly compact.
Because we had all with 10-12 people, and working together, working together.
Sometimes in the sea for 2-three months of files.
And in that legam, you realize that the important thing is the respect that you have for them and they have for you, when you ended a task you can't explain anybody else.
When you go back to the Earth and says, "We've got to do this, and the optical fiber, and the optical fiber, all the technology, and the spread of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect of the perfect of the police that have only the police and knows that they have lived something together, and they don't explain it.
Creating a bond respect a respect of respect.
When I went back to make my next film to make my next film -- I tried to apply the same principle of leadership is to respect the team and change the team and change the team, and in change their respect.
It's really changed the dynamics.
And so here I was once on a little group, in the inexplored line to do "Avatar" with new technologies that didn't existed before.
Terribly emotional.
Tremendously endeavor.
And we became a family, in the argument of four and a half years.
And it completely changed my way to do film.
People who have taken that I've taken from the ocean and I put them on the planet Pandora.
For me, it was the way to do business, the process in itself, which was changed.
What can we can we take it now?
What are the lessons we learn?
I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing we have.
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest reality.
And the respect of the group is more important than all of the world in the world.
Young people come up with me and say, "Dammakes me some advice to do this."
And I say, "Don't ponetimes.
Other people will do it for you, I don't do themselves, you don't realize against yourself.
And you'll rself."
NASA is always telling this sentence, "The error's not contemplato."
But the error has to be an option in the exploration, because it's like to be a saving in the vacuum.
And no important attempt that required innovation has been done without risks.
You've got to be corruptions.
This is the thinking that I want to leave you, which is that in whatever you do, the mistakes is an option, but fearly -- thank you.
If I wanted to understand a single idea would be that the set of the data that we consume is more than its sum of his parts, and instead of thinking about it. And instead of thinking about how to use the information to make new relationships so we see new relationships.
Here you see some statistics of organized mortality of organized mortality.
This instrument that I use is a little experiment.
This is called Pivot, and Pivott I can pick up a single cause of a death, let's say accidents.
And yet we see new relationships.
The reason is that in the central part of the central part of the people are more active and instead of them are more fragile.
We can make a step back, and reorganize the data for death, we see that circulators and cancer, we see that circulators and cancer are the greatest India -- but not for all.
If we go away and film for the age of 40, we see that accidents are the causes of death that the accidents are the causes of death that you will worry about more.
She says closer than for men.
So you've got to visualize that information and data in these way is a little bit like swimming in a sea of swwood information.
And if we can do it with raw data, why don't we also do it with the content?
For example, we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated every Sports.
Everything in the network.
You can go into your rooms and try you.
With Piving a decade.
Or a specific year.
It can be isolating a number in particular.
For example, we take athletes that appear in this number, their sports.
I'm a fan from LArmstrong, so I click here and I see all the numbers in which is appearing LArmstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a look at it, I could think "Why don't you look at all the cycle around the cycle?"
I do a step back, and then I sat up the visual.
And I see Greg Lemond.
You have to understand that when you navigate between the information in this way closer or further away and backward is not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not just a browser.
But you do something else different.
It's a half a half of a second that we can use information.
We still have this idea that it can seem a little bit crazy.
We've taken every single page of Wikipedia, and we reduced it to a little bit of a synthy and a lot of the ick and a icony that indicates the tematic area.
I just show you the first 500 between the most visited Wikipedia.
Even in this slide screened we can do a lot of it.
It turns out what tematic areas of Wikipedia.
And so the government point of government --
We see this option we see that the cheap of Wikipedia more often associated with this voices are "Personages of Time Magazine.
This is significant because it makes it emerging something that in the pages of Wikipedia is not there.
And you see it just by making a step backwards to see the together.
If you take one of these reases can then zooming on the categoria "Personages of Time Magazine.
and see them everybody.
So I see most of the most of government comes from government is from government in the world of the science of a business number of business.
Here's my head.
It comes from music.
And, pretty interesting, what Bond is also won a TED.
So let's save all the winners of the early TED.
For the first time, we're really navigating in the network as if it was a network, but at a level of high abstraction.
I want to show you another thing that might be surprise --
This is the New York Times.
This application -- this application -- we don't call a browser, because it's not a browser, but it still is to see the Web pages -- we add this technology for zoom to every Web, like this.
I can make a step backward and he comes back to a specific section. This is important because the only see the Web pages so shows me all of my navigation.
I can zooming on what I did in a moments.
So here you see the state of the state of the deception I just presented it.
I can see other things that I've seen in the day.
If I want to take a step back, and see all I can do it in my story or the history of my research.
Here I tried to look for the motor Bing the motor Bing, here for Labs Pivot.
And from here I can zooming on my webs and just relaunching from here.
One metaphor reused a lot of times and in every case the result is more than the result of the partments of partly data of parts.
Today, the data has seen as a kind of a bunch of mal.
It talks about swadays of information.
It's talking about range in the data.
And if we put the web on if we put the web underwater the Web underwater instead of pass from one thing to the other, we would habited to go through many things to go to the structure that otherwise can we see the structure that otherwise would you be hidden from each other, can we have hidden to go from one thing to the other thing?
And then instead of hearing us in the data we could really extract information.
Instead of taking information, we can pull out of knowledge.
And by knowledge knowledges to the wisdom.
And with that thank you.
All of these days all talk about happiness.
I asked to count the number of books containing the word "happiness in the title and published in the last five years, have stopped to contact after 40, and there were many more.
There is a huge wells of interest on happiness, between the researchers.
There is very "coaching" about happiness.
Everybody would want to make the happiest people and happy.
But although, all this flow work, there are a series of cognitive traps that somehow cognitive that in some way make it impossible elaborate ideas correct on happiness.
My talk today about today is going to be mainly about these "cognitive traps.
And about it is profane people who think about their happiness, and it's about studying and happiness, because we share that we confused.
The first of these traps is the reluttance to admit the complexity.
It turns out that the word happiness is no longer a word useful word as we appeared too many camps.
I think that you can restringing to a particular significant but in the line of massive -- we have to have this accection and we have to adopt the most complicated vision of what well.
The second traps is the confusion between memory: in a memory and memory. It's basically about choosing between happy and be happy in life and happy about their life.
And these are two concepts of different concept of happiness.
And the third is the illusion of the focused that we can't think about any circumstance that influences on the well-being without distory about the well-being without distory the well-being without distory.
I mean, it's a real cognitive trap.
and there's no way to do the right thing.
I would like to start with one example of one person which, after a session of questions and answers and answers and answers to a story.
It's not clear -- Dissue that while he listen to a absolutely magnific music, just at the end of the registration of the registration of the registration of it.
And then addition to extremendous maniered the entire experience.
But it wasn't true.
And what it was the remember of the experience.
He had lived the experience.
And he heard for 20 minutes of the wonderful music of the wonderful.
but that he didn't count because he stayed with a certain -- I remember; the remember was sunning, and the remember was everything that remains.
What this episode episode says, in the bottom, is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two "y."
There is a slides that lives in the present and you know the present, and it is able to revive the past, but that it basically has the present.
This is about the experiences of the experiences and the doctor of the doctor ask -- you know when the doctor said, "Dr. To you know when the doctor --
And then there is the reminds of the reminds of the story of the story of our life, and it takes the story of our life, and it's the doctor, and it's that the doctor, and it's the doctor, "How do you heard about in the last day?"
or something like this is the journey in Albania?" or something like this.
Those are two different entities, the knowledge, and what if you remember, and what if you remember, and confoundering between two is part of the confusion of happiness.
You know that remember, it's a singing.
And this process starts with a fundamental answer of our reminds -- it starts immediately.
We don't tell stories just when we decide to tell them when we decide to tell them.
Our memory tells us stories, whatever, what you can be our experiences is a story.
Let me start with one example.
This is a old study.
which reports the experiences of two patients during a sweet procedure.
I'm not going to get me in detail. It's not even sweet today, but it was painful when this study was sweet in the 1990s.
He asked the patients to report their pain every 60 seconds.
And here is the results for two patients.
Those are their result.
If you wonderful one?"
It's a very simple question.
Clearly, the Patient B: The Patient B:
And his colony hit led over and for every minute of paining from the patient As the patient of the people who suffered as much as much as much as a hand.
But now there is another question, "How much these patients think of the people think of having to suffering?"
And here is the Patient of the Patient As had a remember of the colony of the column long-worst of the Patic B.
The stories of colony were different than a particular part of the procedure is a way that a term of the procedure is particularly positive -- but one of the two of the two is different -- one of the two is particularly worse -- one of the two is particularly worse than the other.
And the worst is that where the pain was the end of the pain the final moment.
It's a negative story.
How do I know it?
Why do we asked these people after colony after the colony away, so much negatives was the experience, everything that was the experience, everything considerabout?"
And it turned out of a lot of the worst for B, in the remember.
So this is a conflict conflict between the saming that lives the experiences.
From the perspective of the experience, is that experience, is clear that has suffered magally.
So what you could do for the A, and we actually have clinic, and we actually actually did clinic, and it was really done and it would be able to be able to be able to the colony of the Patient As tending the column without smoot.
This is a little bit of pain in the patient in the patient, but just a lot less than before.
And by doing this for a couple minutes, the same, the experience of the Pati's experience. And the he's that remember the experiences of the Patient As a very better than the Patient of his experience.
How do you call a story?
And this is for the stories that are from the reminds that for the stories that we invented a story, are the changes and the final moments and final.
The finals are very, very important and in this case, the final has dominated.
So, the sames that lives the experiences lives his life in a continue.
It has moments in which lives that suspected and and questions: what happens to these moment?
And the answer is simple.
I'm lost to say that most of the moments of our life -- as I calculated them -- I measured them -- I mean that in a life, which means that in a life, we connect about 600 million in a month -- we connect about 600 millions. In a month if they count about 600 millions of which are not left trace.
Most are completely ignored from the sames that remember.
And yet somehow you have a feeling that they should count, that what happens in these moments of experience.
They're the limited resources that we're spending while we're in this world.
And how to spend it, it seems to detect it, but it's not this one of the story that reminds for us.
So we have a slides that reminds and a slide that lives are pretty different.
The biggest difference between two is how to treatment.
From the perspective of the experience that lives the experience, if you walk in the vacations, and the second week is funny as a week of two weeks is two weeks is a week of a week.
But this is not absolutely the way it works the him.
For the slides that remember, a two weeks is a week of a week of a week of vacation because there are no new remembers in addities.
You don't have changed history.
And in this way, the time is the critical variables that distinction is that remember of the saming that experiences.
The time has a limited impact on this story.
Well, the same, the saming experiences more than remembering and tell stories.
It's actually the sames that it takes decisions because, if we look at a patient that has happened, for example, two colony colony with two different medications and is deciding what two different medical choices is what the remind of the doctor, and that will be the rest of choice.
The saming experiences of experiences has no voice in these choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experience, but between the reminds of those experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future as experience.
We think of our future as ancient ancient memories.
And basically, you can think of this situation, like a tyrannia and you can think of the same, and you can think of how to turn the knows that it is that lives the experiences through experiences of any experiences the experiences of any experiences the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of the experiences of it.
I have a feeling that when we go into the vacation is often the case that you have to be a good part of the service of our sames that remember.
And this is a little hard to justify it.
Oh, how do we consume our memories?
This is one of the explanations that comes given for the predomination of the team that remember.
When I think about that, it is a vacation in the Antarctica, a few years ago, which is one of the best vacation of my life, and I think I relatively often relatively often in other vacations.
And I probably spend thinking about that journey of that journey of three weeks, in the last four years.
If I never opened the carefully with 600 photographs of the journey, I would have spent another hour and and a half weeks a hours of journey and a half of a hour.
Well, I could be a little bit extremely extreme, in my shot consumption, but even if you do more than that, but even though you do more than that, a genuine question.
Why are we going to heavy memory respect to the weight that we have the experience?
Now I want you to think about a experiment with thought.
Imagine that during the next vacations, you know that at the end of the vacation of the vacation of all photographs will be destroyed, and you will take a medicine for the amnesia so you don't remember anything.
Would you be weigh? And if you could choose a different vacation? And if you could choose a conflict between two slides and you have to think about how to solve conflict and actually not that why, if you think in terms of time you have a answer.
And if you think in terms of remember, you could get another answer.
The because we choose the vacation that we do, is a problem that put us in front of the two of the side.
The two hundreds of happiness.
There are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use, one for each other.
So what is the experience?
And then you wonder: how happy are the moments in the slide?
And this is about -- happiness for moments is a complicated process.
What are the emotions that we can measure?
And, by the way, now we are able to make us good idea of happiness of the happiness that lives the experiences in time.
If you ask about the happiness of the team, it's a completely different thing.
This is not how happy a living person alive.
This is how satisfaced or compleasy is the person when it thinks to his life.
It's a very different.
Anybody is not going to be able to distinguish these two notions, not to create confusions of happiness, and I appeared to a group of well-being, and I appeared to a lot of well-being, which have shaped exactly in this way.
The difference between happiness and happiness that lives the experiences and satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the slides of slides to measuring the two separately, the Gallup has a world's institute where over over over the middle of people have been subway of thinking about their life and their experiences.
And there were other studies in this direction.
So in the last few years, we started learning about the happiness of the two sames.
And the biggest lesson that we learn, is that they're very different.
You might know how much a person is satisfaced with your life, and yet it doesn't tell you about how happy they are living their lives and the vicepherd.
To give you an idea of the correlation is about 0.5.
What does that means if you mean that if you mean that if you mean that if you mean that if you mean that if you mean that you know about his heith?
Well, you know something about his height, but with a lot of uncertainty.
You always have a little bit of uncertainty.
If I tell you somebody thinks that his life is at the eight in a scale from one to 10 to a 10 of happy -- you will be very uncertainly uncertainly about how experiences.
So the correlation is low.
We have a certain knowledge of what controls is happy --
We know that the money is very important, the goals are very important,
We know that it's happy to be happy means to be satisfacts with people that we like to be satisfaced with people that we like it.
There are other pleasures, but these are the main these are the main the main of them.
So if you want to massive the happiness of the two of the wall, you end up doing very different things.
The conclusion of what I said is that we shouldn't think about happiness as well-being.
This is two completely different ideas completely different ideas well.
In more quickly quickly, another reason why we can't think we can think about in a linear happiness is that we don't take attention to the same things when we think about life.
So if you do the simple questions about how happy is happy people in California, you can't get the correct answer.
When you ask this question, think you should be more happy in California, which in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about life in California and other places and other places and other places and other places and other places and other places --
Well, it turns out that climate is not so important for the same, and it's not very important for the experiences and it's not very important for the same, which is what happy is the people.
But since the sat is that reflects is in care, you could finish -- some powerful people in California.
And it's interesting what will happen to happen to people that turn into California in California in the hope of being happy.
Well, the sames that lives the experience is not going to become happy.
We know it.
But something will happen. Think will be more happy, because when they think they're going to remember how terrible was in Ohio.
And they will think about having the right decision.
It's very hard to think of clearly about well-being and I think I had the idea of how hard it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question.
Thank you very much.
When we were at the telephone a couple of weeks ago, that a interesting result that a interesting result of the Gallup.
Is it something that thinks we can share we going to share we still have?
Daniel Kahneman: Of course.
I believe that the result that we found in the Gallup is a number that we weren't expected expected to find.
We found that, with a reference to happy about the experience.
When we looked at how we heard of a 60,000 dollars a year, we discovered that under a 60,000 dollars a year, for American ans, for American year, for American -- about 60,000-Americans, on a very vast sample of about 600,000 Americans, it is a representative representative of a 600,000 dollars a year.
CA: 60,000 dollars a year, 60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they become progressively more unhappy than that, we find a poor, All of that we find a flap.
I mean, I've seen a rarely of the lines.
All of course, what happens is that money doesn't buy happiness of experience, but the lack of money, and we can measure that misery certainly water and we can measure that misery very, very clearly.
In terms of the other hand, the same, it's another story.
More money leaders, more content.
This is not going to be emotional on emotions.
CA: But Danny, all the efforts of the Americans are about life, the liberty, the research of happiness.
If people take this discovery, in the discovery, it practice it all that we believe, for example, politics on the tissue and so on.
There is the possibility that politics, and the country in general, can you take a discovered as that seriously and bringing a public policy based on it.
DK: You're that I think it recognize the role of happiness in the politics.
The press of consideration will be slowed in the United States, but in the U.K., it's becoming reality, and in other states.
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about politics.
It will be half a little bit and people will begin to discusses if they want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the valuable of life.
As a happiness to acknowledge, it takes different directions to how you think of how you think, and second you think of himself that it makes the experiences.
All this influence, I think, in the years that was true.
In the United States, are doing some efforts to measure the experience of happiness of the population.
And that, I think, will come in the next decadecade, maybe two of the country.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this is going to be like that, or for the most interesting political discussion of politics that most interesting politics to follow in the next years.
Thank you very much for behavioral economy.
Thanks Danny Kahneman.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate.
It can seem to seem strange in my job to the foundation of vaccines, things to invent and giving the world to help two billions of the poorest people to live lives.
But climate and energy, in fact, they're extremely importantly important for this people, are more important for them than anybody else in the world.
A lot of climate worst for many years old.
It will be too much rained or too little bit.
They will change them in ways that their environment simply can't support it.
It takes to fame. At incertainty.
So, climate change climmatics, will be for them terribles.
Even the cost of energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you can lower the price of one thing, to reduce poverty, to reduce poverty, to choose much energy.
The price of energy is down in time.
And a civilization progress to progress in energy field.
The carbon revolution has allowed that industry.
And even in the 20th century we seeing a quick decline in the price of electricity, which explain why we have frigerators, we can create modern materials and do so many things.
So in the rich world, we are how much about electricity in a situation of excellent situation.
But while the price scenes, for example, of course, we have to respect a new win CO2.
CO2 is is a heavy scale the planet, and his equation.
CO2 empowered a temperature, which induces very negative.
And the climate, perhaps even worse indeed, in the sense that the natural ecosystems can't get up to acadewater these rapids changes and so they collapsing.
The valutation of how you increase temperature because of a CO2, and as each other, and as each of two things worse -- it's uncertainly, but not much.
And there is certainly uncertainty about how negatives will be extremely negative."
And I often asked to the best scientists -- we really have to reduce the emissions?
We can't only reduce them to a quarter?
And the answer is that, until we down to zero, the temperature will continue to salie.
This is a great challenge, so that's a challenge.
It's not like to say, "Let's go through a 3.5 feet, under 3.5 miles under 3."
This is not about "leave it a whil."
This is where we have to go to zero.
Now, we employ CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons.
About 20 tons for every American.
For the poors of poor, is less than a ton a capital.
The world's average is about five tons of capital.
And somehow, we have to make progress that amount to zero.
The emissions are constantly at all.
Only some changes have changed this tendency, so we have to go from the increase to the declining up to the zero.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series of multiplications.
We've got the left, CO2, the CO2, who have to be building, and the farm on the right are population, the services that in the average of every person use, the average of every person use, the average of every person use of energy.
We go to each factor and we see how we can see how we can do it.
You know, one of these numbers must leave up in almost zero.
It's about high high school algeebry algeebry algeebry.
Let's see a while.
The first face is population.
The world has today 6.8 billion habitants.
We go to nine billion.
If we do a good job with the new vaccines, health reproductive and health reproductive, we can declined 10, 15 percent, but we region a 30 percent.
The second factor is the services that we use it.
It knows everything, the food we eat, the vestarium, the TV, the warming.
They're wish, and free of poverty means to provide these services for almost everybody in the world.
And it's a good thing that this number of increases.
In the rich world, in the rich world, probably we could save and use men, but in average, every year, this number of salize.
And so complex, the amount of services that are going to be than double.
This is a very simple example of service.
You've got the illumination in your house to do company, but these guys are not so they read and read their own company, and they read their tasks.
How much efficiency -- E, the energy for the unity of services -- here are very good news.
This is not increasing it.
Thanks to many inventions, new ways of illuminate different ways, automobiles made differently, by many services can declined to a lot of services can declined energy.
In some services you can reduce 90 percent.
There are other services, like fertilizers, or aircrawl, or the airplane, where the margins of improvement are very, very infertilizens are very, very infertilizers.
So, complex, in the best of the best consumed energy can be reduced by three perhaps to six times.
But these first three factors reduce emissions from 26 to the best of the best of the tons 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
We look at the fourth factor, the key amount of CO2 embodies for energy.
The question is, can we reduce it to zer?
If you burns carbon it.
If you burn natural gas, no.
Almost all of the ways to produce electricity today and ruseful in the renewable and nuclear CO2.
And what we have to do on global scale -- so that's to create a new system.
And we need energy miracrocoast.
Col terms of "mirac," I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. The person is a miracle.
Internet, and his services, I'm a miracle.
People here today have a creation of many miracles.
We usually don't have a scadence, a date within which I think you have miracle.
Soney, it's a window, and something else.
In this case we have to drive all the speed, and make a miracle in a very rise of very rise --
I asked myself how to illustrate that concept that?
Can example, some natural example that captured the imagination of people?
I rethought about a year ago, when I brought to the mosquitoes and people found it fun.
They realized them that, in the world, there are people who are connecting with mosquitoes.
This is my idea for energy.
I decided that to fly slight would be this year my contribute.
Here's the lights here.
They tell me that not point, they could not get out of the boat.
So now we can invent it as well as this -- but they won't be help.
We need solutions, one or many that they are, who are going to work on great scale and very affified and very affified in many directions, I think only five can five effects in many directions.
I excuse the bong, the geo-fusion nuclear fusion of nuclear fuel biofuel --
They could also give some contributes, and if they can do more than I expect that I expect me expected that we're going to work on each of these five, and not snone of these five, and not swalks at all.
We go for the first fossil fuel fuel fuel, carbon or gas or natural gas or gas that it is.
Here's our task is simple, but it's not to capture it is, and it's not to capture the CO2, after the combustion, to the outside of the field of the figure -- and hopefuel that we can get us with it.
There are experimental technologies that caught the 60 percent of CO2 percent of CO2 percent of CO2 percent will be very complicated and it's going to be difficult to deal with all of this CO2.
The most expensive issue is still that in the long term.
Who will be track?
Who is something that is literally billions of times more voluminous than every other kind of imagine, like nuclear or other?
It's a huge volume huge --
So it's a difficult problem.
The other source would be the nuclear --
But nuclear presents three big problems.
The cost, especially in very regulated, is high.
The issue of safety safety that nothing can go wrong wrong, bad the implants of human operators, and that the combustible doesn't come come to beautiful.
And how do you manage the scores?
Malgrade redoctor, concerns are so much.
People need to be renched.
So you have very difficult, gives you a lot of difficult, and on what you should be work.
The last three of the five sources I skilled them up.
They're those that people often define "rinnovabli."
And to say the real vantage of the great advantage of not to require a combustible fuel.
The first is that the density of energy produced with these technologies is decidedly inference to a central electrical center.
This is about "to harvest energy, and so many kilometers of square kilometers.
And these sources.
The sunlips all day, not all the day, not all the day, and the wind suffers.
So if you depends on these sources, you have to find a way to find a way of herogue electrical energy.
Grosse challenges attending us on the front of the costs.
And the distribution.
For example, let's say that this energy source in the outside.
So not just need technology, but you have to do the technology, but you also have to do the risk of the risks of the outside.
And then the problem of the accumulate problem.
For estimate the size of the problem, I analyzed all kinds of bacterial bacteries today -- and whatever, I confronted them with the amount of electrical energy electrical energy electrical energy electrical energy that all the bacteries now in production could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to produce that energy in production that energy.
So we really need a big favor, a half improvement to the approaches now in use.
which is not impossible, but it's not very simple.
This problem is already when the sources "intermitt" produce more dels, say, 20 or 30 percent of consumption energy.
If you go to those sources for 100, you need a miracle battery battery --
But how are we going to add this street up? What's the right approach?
This is a Manhattan? What could you solve the problem?
A lot of company, at hundreds and hundreds and work.
We need at least people in each of these five sectors.
Most of them, looking at them, you know, crazy. And that's good.
And I think that here, in the TED group, many people are already working in these fields.
Bill Gross a different companies between which one of the eSolar that vanta-large technologies in the termic solar with the termic solar with the termic solar that an eSolar that a vantge of companies in which a great eSolar that a vantage of an eSolar that an eSolar which is an eSolar that an eSolar which is an eSolar which is an eSolar which is an eSolar Gross the thmic Gross a line called eSolar that a great ea great e;
The Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and they have interesting things and have interesting and potential potential, and I'm giving my support to all this.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that you will surprised you follow the street of nuclear --
There were some innovations in the branch, the nuclear nuclear of modular --
But from a little time of time, the sector, the sector, that there are some good ideas around is not so amazing.
The idea of Terrapower is that, instead of burning only the uranium, the U235 percent of the available, we decided to burning the U238, 99999999999 percent of the U238, 9999999 percent of it.
For the truth if you talk about a long time, but it was never adequately tried if it would work or not, just because of the modern supercomputer today -- you can do a simulation and see that yes, with the right materials, with the right materials -- it seems to work.
And since it burning 99 percent of the uranium, the structure of the best costs of the best costs.
They burn the scores, and they use as fuel as fuels as a fuels of today, that become from the problem that they weren.
It turns out the uranoid while the person is proced. It's kind of a dogen can.
It's like a wood wood that burns burn. It's called progressive.
From the point of the fuels of the combustible problem is solve.
Here's a picture of a place in Kentucky.
This is scared, 99 percent of the uranium, which was taken the part of the uranium, which is called the fuel hour.
These energy would give them energy to the U.S. for centuries.
And by filtering water with a economic process, there would be a lot of the rest of the life of this planet.
So a lot of challenges attended, but this is an example of hundreds of ideas that we need to progress.
How should we measure our progres?
What should they have to count your pays?
We Identify the goal -- and then we valued the past of the medium.
You've heard a lot of people talking about 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's very important to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a reduction of 80 percent reduction.
20 percent will be produced by poor, and from a little agriculture.
At that point, we have solved the deforestation and production of cement.
To get to 80 percent, therefore countries, including countries like China, will have to replace completely their electrical production.
The other question is, are we doing this technology to zero-emission?
We put it in practice in the develop?
We are we spreading it even else?
It's a important.
It's a key element of the page.
Do you go to back, what would you look like to have the page of 20?
And that should have the same two expects of it.
We should be implementing of efficiency measureductions.
As we emboard, minor minor is the total amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this matter, doing things that doesn't behave big big reductions, has a weight part, or even until well.
We have to push these progress all over speed, and we can measure the speed from the number of company, projects pilots, and regular regulations.
Many opties have written books have written about it.
The Al Gor, "The Gors," and the David McKay, "Sustainable Sustainable Sustainable Without the Hot Air."
These books beyond the problem and create a context in which to do the debate.
A lot of things have to have contemporary contemporary of it.
So I have a wish,
A very concrete wish that we have technology necessary.
If I had to choose one wish for the next 50 years, you know, you could choose the president of the country, the realization of a vaccine, which I can keep in a lot, or to make this thing that cost half and you can't make this one thing that cost half of CO2, I would choose this last ma.
It would be that in the greatest impact.
If this wish is not going to do it, the fraction between who thinks and who's long-terrible, between the U.S. and China, between countries and rich, the most of those two billion people will be able to be great, and most of those two billion people will be great.
What do we have to do we have to do we do that?
What am I inviting you to take the initiative and proced?
It's necessary more substantial research.
When countries to get together in places like Copenhagen, they shouldn't just talk about CO2.
It should be discussion also should be the innovations, and stupid how much much much of invested in these innovative approaches.
We need incentives, taxes on CO2, the "cap and trade," instruments that evidence the cost of the pollution.
We have to spread the message.
We have to make this more rational dialogue and understandable and understandable, and it needs to include the government.
It's a challenge wish wall, but I think it able.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you. Just to know more about Terrapower on Terrapower --
before all, you can give us a idea of the investment?
Bill Gates: Read the software, to buy the supercomputer, to be all the great scientists, what we already did, requires only tens of millions, and even when we have tested the materials in a Russix of a million-on-a-million-on-on-on-million-on-on-a-million-on-on-year-old.
The difficult thing is to build the pilot, to find out various billions, the place in which is going to be built the first one that will be built the first example.
Once we built the first one, if it works like announced -- it's going to be the coast of Colomb, because the costs, the density of generated energy that we know today.
CA: So, if I understand this imply pattern, that the construction of a vertical combustible combustible nuclear fuel.
And then the process starts from the high and progress towar?
BG: Yeah. The reactors, today, are being continuously reforness, many controls that can not work, opening and expect --
It's not good.
If the combustible is very cheasier and you can do it for 60 years, put it for 60 years, put it in and forgotten all of complexity.
It is burns burns for sex.
CA: A nuclear nuclear implanting that makes from itself!
BG: Yeah. Well, you can leave them up, you can let them into another reactor.
And we're going to begin with the existing reject, now we are now conserved in the vases of cooling or containers close to reactors.
They will be our first fuel.
So what was a problem of conventional reactors will be the fuel of the nostris, and the volume of the refying of refying rejectory, not just this process will be reality.
CA: But when I talk around the world of the potential of this technology where is more interest reduced interest to his realization?
BG: Well, there is no place place in particular and there are all these interesting rules about transparency about everything that is called nuclear -- and so interest.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I just met the Segretary for Energia.
We've talked about how this idea became to the current program.
I'm optimist. Francescesies and Japanese did in this field.
It's a variation about something that has been done.
This is a sustaining improvement, but it's a quickly reactor that a lot of countries have built a fast-built reactor, so everybody who has built a good candidate our reactor.
CA: Are you have, what are the days and the probability that something like to do you realize that?
BG: Well, for one of these projects at the entire scale that produces energy, which is not very, we talk about 20 years to design it.
This is the scadence that the environmental models,
Terrapower, if everything else good, which is not asking a pocket could easily this goal.
And now they are, fortunately, the dozens of companies in the sector, whether their research, if the fundamental functions, if the fundaments for their pilots of pilots of their pilots of pilots of their piloss --
And it's better if a lot of solution will have successful, because at that point, you can remember to a set of solutions.
It's necessary that at least a success.
CA: Would you talk about important, revolutionary, this is the biggest you know?
BG: A energy revolution is the most important.
It would have been without the environmental win, but the wine will be very much more important.
We have other innovators.
We don't know their jobs like this, but one is the nuclear nuclear -- a different approach.
There is a liquid reactor. It seems to me to do that, but maybe they say the same thing of us.
So there are different different things, but the beautiful is that a molecule, a molecule, a million times more energy than a million times more energy than a molecule, if you can deal with the negestern aspects -- if you can do it almost a million times on the environment, in terms of effects on the environment, in terms of effects on the environment,
CA: And if it doesn't work, what do we do?
We shouldn't begin to adopt measures to try and keep the temperature on the stable lands?
BG: If you find you in that situation, it's a little bit like when you eat too much, and you have to have a heart attack.
Where are you going to go to that point? You could have a surgeon or something like this.
There is a lot of research line, which are various techniques that are various techniques that would slow down the warming of the rewarming facing us 20 or 30 years in which coordinate the action.
It's like to stipular a policy.
I hope not needs to have.
Some people say that you shouldn't even work on the poly-because you might be in the policy because you could be savailed to save you.
I don't think this is a choice, says the importance of the problem of the problem of the geoengineering of the solutions in the case that the falls in the case that the fall, or the innovations come more than the predict of the predictions.
CA: If I had a sentence: if I had a phrase or two to dir them, how could you persuade them that they have come back?
BG: Well, it too much, there are different types of skeptics and the ones that are very little bit of them.
Some people say that there is a negative feedback to the clouds that are deadly deaths to the effect of the warm.
They're very, very few things that you can only say that there is a probability on a million that you have this probability on a million that you have the main the AIDS.
You start a mistay and you paying the consequences only a lot of later.
And so, when you have emergence, you know, the idea of doing sacrifices that you can see results that you see results --
Sacrifices for achieved achievements.
In fact, the IPPPPC is not necessarily perspective, the worst case. There is people in the rich world that looks at the IPPC and says, okay, it's not so bad.
The fact is that uncertainty should be push to action.
But my dream is, if we can do that if we can make it economically, and respect the wine of CO2, then the skeptic diggers. I don't care if you don't emitt CO2, almost preferency that I would emitem because it's more economic technologies.
CA: It would that be your answer to the reasoning of the Bjorn Lomb, which if you invest all your energies and trying to solve the problem of CO2, your other goals -- will be sacrificed. And that will be sacrificed. And what do you mean to do it means to do it resources in a way of stupid stupid?
BG: Well, the expensive, and developing --
We say that the U.S.A should spend 10 billion in more than they do now is not so the ingen.
It shouldn't distract resources.
The things that behavior, and here people are reasonable to be reasonable to degrees are the anti-economic solutions of economic solutions.
For me is most of that, I know.
Unless you fund learning curve to learn curve to learning, close to the point where it's going to become very economic efforts are concentrated in technologies that have the potential of low-low-low-low-lowing drastically.
If the alternative of the fossel energy as a cost-rich energy can be affordable energy, all of the people can afford to pay the energy of five times as much without change.
The disaster would be for those two billion.
And Lomborg has reviewed his positions.
His argument, "Why isn't you discussing more than Ricerk and Switnes?"
For his past, you still get it between the skeptics, but he realized that it's a swearing group, and so it's he's a bunch of Ricerk and Svilup.
And it's a question that I think it's appropriate that I think it's appropriate it.
It's amazing how little you invest in research and development.
CA: Well, I think of the audience of the audience, saying that I hope to see your desire to be to see your desire to become reality.
BG: Thank you.
I want to sharing with you a discovery that I did a few months ago, while I was writing a Wired.
I always have my dictionary of the synonymous, whenever I write something, but I had already up the article and I realized that I never in my life looking for the word "disastable," to see what I was going to find it.
Let me read you the result.
"Deat," aggettive -- indeed, unusely, inated, unuseful, slicked awesides, extremendous, extremendous unced Indeboliting, handappeared, sent, settled by the circulation, settled by the circulation, soulders and debols.
Contrari: In form, strone; able.
I was reading this high list to a friend to a friend and beginning, it was so ridiculous, but as I read to the word mutiled my voice, and I had to stop up and I had to stop out of shock and the impact that the axis and the impact of these words have left me on these words have left to left it.
You know, we're talking absolutely about one of my old dictionary.
I'm thinking, it's going to be an old, right.
But, in fact the building was early 80s.
when I was starting the elementary schools and learning what was out of my family and learning what existed out of my family and other children and the world around me.
And unuseful to say that, thank God I didn't use the dictionary of the synonymous,
I mean, from this explanation seems that I was born in a world that you see someone like me as one who has nothing positive in any way for them, whatever it is -- they celebrated for opportunities and the adventure that my life has procured.
So, I am immediately went to see on 2009 in the network, expected to find a review without value.
This is the version of description.
Unfortunately, it's not very much better.
I find the last two words under the last two words under the slides of the words and "inter" and healthcare about the words.
That's what we believe people when we nomind them with these words --
It's about valuable values behind these words, and how we build these values.
Our flu language our thinking and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, a lot of civilizations, including that Greek and the Romana, believed that it was more powerful than the verbly voices -- because to say things else.
So, what do we want to bring to exist, a person who is limited, or a person with more force?
So if you do something simple like to nominate a person, a child, we could put them on a baby, we could put them on their force.
Do we wouldn't we open the port of port for them?
One person who opened the doctor -- it was the doctor of that I was a child All'istitute in Wilmington Wilmington, Delaware.
His name is Dr. Pizush Pizusual.
ItaloAmerican, whose name, which I apparently, was too hard to pronounce for most Americans, so it became doctors.
And the door to wear door to wearing colored and a perfect clination to work with children.
I was almost anything of the time I spent in the hospital, with the exception of physical sessions of physical sessions.
I had to do what seemed to be infinite repetition with these big elastic, in different colors, you know, in different colors -- to help build the muscles of the legs.
And I hate these elastic elastic elastics anything.
And I hate them and I got them really hated.
And, you know, I knew to treat, like a five years, with Dr. I have to try to get out of these exercizes, Inuan.
And, one day, it came to one of my seats and unexorablies, these sites.
And he said, "Oh, you're a wow, Aimee, six a child, so lucky, I think that I went to break one of those phases.
"When the break, I will give you 100 dollars."
Now, clearly was just a little maneuversus of the doctors to make me exercizes that I didn't want to do to the perspective of the second plan, what he did did did did was to give a different shape of a different shape of day.
and turn it into an interesting experience for me.
And I wonderful today, the entity of his vision, and his declaration about me as a fortune child, he redefined my view of me in a lucky, powered and the personal person to the future.
This is an example of how adults with positions of power can inflamed the force of a child.
But, in the first of those definitions of the vocabulary of the synonims, our language of our language of our language to the reality that everybody wants to see if we want to see if you like.
Our language, not at the step of changes of our societies, many of which have been created by technology.
of course, from a medium, from a average point of view, my legs, the operations, the laboration of the head-ey-ey-ey-eyed bodies that are helping people to cooperate with their skills, and move to the ability that nature's ability that nature has impointed to the platforms of the social network, allows of social network, allows with people to identify their choices of description of themselves, so you can descript with global set.
So, maybe technology is being revealing more clearly what has always been a truth, which each one has something rare and powerful to make it and power to our society, and the human ability to adapt us is our biggest quality.
The human ability to adapt it, it's something interesting, because people always wanted to talk to me a difficulty sources and I have to admit challen.
This sentence never good, and I sented up to me in the answer to people to this review that I think I'm starting to understand why.
It's subject in this sentence, insurprisable adversity, is the idea that successful or happiness, is to reemerging from the other side of a challenge of this experience, if my success in life of this experience, if my success in life has come from a schiving schiving or circumnavigation of a life with the protess, or what people lose like my disability.
But in fact, we have changed, we have changed, logically, from a challenge of a challenge, physically or both.
And I would suggest that it's a good thing.
It's not a obstacle that we have to add our life.
It's part of our life.
And I mean to think that it's like my shadow.
Sometimes unning, and sometimes almost for anything, but it's always with me.
And, of course, not slowing to decrease the impact, the weight of a person.
There are adversities and challenges in life, and it's all true and relative to every single person, but the question is not if you have adversities or or or not, but how you go to deal with it.
So, our responsibility is not just to protect people to us to care about ourselves from avversity, but to make them in the right way.
And we do a damage to our children when we make it not ready to fit up.
There is a difference and distinction between the medical medical objective of being an amputed person, and the subjective of the society that I seeing me disability or not.
And truth, the only disability is that I had to face is if the world ever thought I could be described by those words.
In our wishes to protect those that we loving a cold truth of their medical prognos, really, the truths of their expectancy for their expectancy of life, we have to be safe the first morning. We're not going to put somebody.
Maybe the model of looking at only at the model of watching and how to put it back to you and how to put it on the most subject that the disease of the subject that the disease itself.
In not to be a person in the complete, you don't do to understand his potentiality, we are creating another disease of disease in addition to the natural suffering that already.
We're effectively giving a value of a person in our community.
So we have to see through the disease and within the elency of human ability.
And much more importantly, there's a relationship between those insufficiency perceived and our greatest creativity.
So, it's not to be proposed to svalue, these number of research as something that we want to avoid or whatever we want to be able to find those opportunities to tell you in a accident.
So, the idea that I want to explain is that there is not what as to be a adversity, as to be able to be able to use a term of a lotl of the liber, maybe even dance of the lotboundance, maybe also dance together.
And, perhaps, if we look at a crink like a natural and useful, and we are fewer from his presence.
This year, we celebrate the complex of Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, and it was 150 years ago, when he wrote about evolution, which Darwin has illustrated illustrated, the truth to the human carefully.
For to say it in another way, is not the strongest of the expects that survive, and it's not even the most smart, is what the most smart, is the most smart changes.
The conflict is the genesis of cracking.
Darwin Darwin, between other things, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and developed from the spirit of human spirit through the conflicts in transformation.
So, again, transformation, adaptly; it's our biggest quality.
And, maybe, we don't know what we did, we don't know what we're made of.
Maybe that's what gives us adversity, a sense of possibly can be -- a sense of its force.
So we can make a gift.
We can re-imagine available adversity like something more difficult.
Maybe we can see it as a change.
It's a change of which is a change that that we haven't adapted.
I believe that the biggest adversity that we created is this idea of normal. Now, who is normal?
There is no normal Churn is a typical. There is a typical.
And you want to meet those few grid people if there are it?
I don't think about it.
If we changed this paradigm from one of how to get the normality to be able to be able to be adigned, or potentiality, to be an adigned, we can understand the force of so many children, and inviting them to their precise their precious ability with community.
The anthropologists teach us that what we us, as human, as human, we always wanted to contributed the members of our community is to be help.
There is an evidence that in Olanda, 60,000 years ago, they brought to the old trip of the old and the subjects with hurts, maybe because of the experience and survival of these people was the value of the community of these people was the value of the community: They didn't see this people like a rare and value.
A few years ago, I was in a market of citizone where I grew up in that red area in the north of the Pennsylvania.
and I was in front of a touch of a touches.
And I was summer and I had a shorty pants.
I heard this guy, his voice behind me and said, "Aimee Mullins." And I wanted to be a half a age. I didn't have any idea of who was.
And I said, "Do you lead us -- I don't remember that I have never met me met them to have it in the house you haven't remember you met to have met you have.
I mean, when we met you were born up with your mother."
GOh, that guy.
And, of course, but I was playing a camp.
That means was the Dr. Kean, a man I had just been given to my mother on that days I had to have my mother, because clear, clear, typically, I came to retary.
And so, the kneecologist of my mother had gone in vacations, so the man who did me was a complex extraney, and the man who did was an extract for my parents.
And because I was born without the lost and I had the boney, some finger in this feet, and some of the finger, and some in that he had had to be the bad news to be bad news.
She said, "I had to give this one to your parents you would never walked up in my children, and you'd never had the kind of mobility that have other children, or no independent, and you gave me a good kind of independent life in my school, and you gave me that I had told me that he had told me that he told me that he had told me that he won my childhad, which I had won my childhood,
that I had marched with Girl Scout, you know, the Halloween, I had won my house studio, or all of the sportion of my studio, or all the sports of the sportion of his school medicine school, by teaching the Hahny's school medicine school in Hahnemang and Hershey.
And he called this part of the course of the X, the X, the potentiality of the human will will bee.
You can have no progrid of how power can be and as a determining in the quality of a person.
And the Kean Kean continued to explain me and said, "Nella, to my experience, unless it is that it doesn't come repeated, and even though it is given a baby support, if it's left to be a child come up with us.
You see, Dr. Kean has changed his opinion.
It has a difference between a medical condition, and what each one can do with it.
And there was a change in my thinking about the years, if you had 15 years old, if I had 15 years old, if I had 15 years old, if I wouldn't have a second.
I was going to have that kind of normality at that time.
If you ask me today, I'm not sure.
And it's because of the experiences I had with them, not for the experiences I had with them.
And perhaps, the change in me is happened because I was more than people who opened to me the doors of those who opened me of those who obstacularly had to do
You see, everything you need is a person that you show you the epiphysical of your potentiality of your potentiality, if you can give someone the key of their force, the human spirit is so rich, if you can do it and open a door to someone in a cras, you can be a door someone in the best of the modis.
You're teaching them to open the door open.
In fact, the significance of the word education is from the "education is from the "De" that means -- to bring out of the potential.
So again, what is the potential that we want to get out of it?
There was a case studio in the 1960 in the 1960 in Grand short schools.
It's called the "continuity," we call it the "alinevidence here in the United States.
It means separate students dependent on their voices.
And the students with the best voices have a harder program, and they did it for a three months, and they did it for a three-months, and students with voices officer they said, "optimos." The optimos," which were smart -- that were intelligent.
And at the end of this period of three months, they were having a results of the optimos." And of course, the trister of this student of this student student of this student studio, and they took some of this studio, and they said they said, "Otti" -- that's what happened to the end of the three months.
The ones that were standing to school, beyond to the ones I had left --
The critical part of this study was that even the teachers were winging.
The teachers didn't know that it had been done this change.
And that was simple -- these are the students from optime: These are the insufficient.
And so it's how they started teaching them.
So I believe that the real disability is to have a damage, and a damage, and a damaged no hope.
You can't see beauty.
It has no longer our natural children, care and our innate ability to imagine.
if you aging it, we can support the human spirit to keep the hope, to see the beauty in order to see the beauty in order to be imaginative and curious curious and curious curious.
When the spirit has these quality, we can create new reality new ways of it.
I want to leave you with a poem poem from a 1300 called Hafiz -- who had 1300 called Hafiz Jacques Dembois --
and the poem is called "The dio that knows just four parole," "Every child -- "Every child -- not the God of NO, the God who only knows knows four four words and continued to measure, but the God that only knows four words and continued to ball with me.
Thank you.
