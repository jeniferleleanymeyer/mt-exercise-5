# MT Exercise 5: Byte Pair Encoding, Beam Search
This repository is a starting point for the 5th and final exercise. As before, fork this repo to your own account and the clone it into your prefered directory.

## Requirements

- This only works on a Unix-like system, with bash available.
- Python 3 must be installed on your system, i.e. the command `python3` must be available
- Make sure virtualenv is installed on your system. To install, e.g.

    `pip install virtualenv`

## Steps

Clone your fork of this repository in the desired place:

    git clone https://github.com/[your-name]/mt-exercise-5

Create a new virtualenv that uses Python 3.10. Please make sure to run this command outside of any virtual Python environment:

    ./scripts/make_virtualenv.sh

**Important**: Then activate the env by executing the `source` command that is output by the shell script above.

Download and install required software as described in the exercise pdf.

Download data:

    ./download_iwslt_2017_data.sh
    
Before executing any further steps, you need to make the modifications described in the exercise pdf.

    ./scripts/preprocess.sh 

cuts of the first 100â€™000 of the downloaded training files.

    ./scripts/subword_voci.sh 

creates the necessary code files and vocabularies (sizes 2000 & 5000) that are used for the training of `transformer_model_2` and `transformer_model_3`.

    ./scripts/train_model_1.sh 
    
trains the first model that is based on word level with a vocabulary size of 2000.

    ./scripts/train_model_2.sh 
    
trains the second model that is based on bpe level with a vocabulary size of $2000$ and the previously created vocabulary and code files. 

    ./scripts/train_model_3.sh 

trains the third model that is based on bpe level with a vocabulary size of $5000$ and the previously created vocabulary and code files. 

    ./scripts/evaluate_model_1.sh 

creates the translation based on `transformer_model_1`

    ./scripts/evaluate_model_2.sh 

creates the translation based on `transformer_model_2`

    ./scripts/evaluate_model_3.sh 

creates the translation based on `transformer_model_3`

    ./scripts/table.sh

creates the table in a .csv file and the plots that show the relationship between beam size, BLEU score and generation times.
